<span class="fs70">(BUFFALO BILL).</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is now some generations since Josh Billings, Ned
Buntline, and Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, intimate friends
of Colonel William F. Cody, used to forgather in the
office of Francis S. Smith, then proprietor of the <cite>New
York Weekly</cite>. It was a dingy little office on Rose Street,
New York, but the breath of the great outdoors stirred
there when these old-timers got together. As a result of
these conversations, Colonel Ingraham and Ned Buntline
began to write of the adventures of Buffalo Bill
for Street &amp; Smith.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody was born in Scott County, Iowa, February
26, 1846. Before he had reached his teens, his
father, Isaac Cody, with his mother and two sisters,
migrated to Kansas, which at that time was little more
than a wilderness.</p>

<p>When the elder Cody was killed shortly afterward in
the Kansas “Border War,” young Bill assumed the difficult
rôle of family breadwinner. During 1860, and until
the outbreak of the Civil War, Cody lived the arduous
life of a pony-express rider. Cody volunteered his services
as government scout and guide and served throughout
the Civil War with Generals McNeil and A. J.
Smith. He was a distinguished member of the Seventh
Kansas Cavalry.</p>

<p>During the Civil War, while riding through the streets
of St. Louis, Cody rescued a frightened schoolgirl from
a band of annoyers. In true romantic style, Cody and
Louisa Federci, the girl, were married March 6, 1866.</p>

<p>In 1867 Cody was employed to furnish a specified
amount of buffalo meat to the construction men at work
on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. It was in this period
that he received the sobriquet “Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>In 1868 and for four years thereafter Colonel Cody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
served as scout and guide in campaigns against the Sioux
and Cheyenne Indians. It was General Sheridan who
conferred on Cody the honor of chief of scouts of the
command.</p>

<p>After completing a period of service in the Nebraska
legislature, Cody joined the Fifth Cavalry in 1876, and
was again appointed chief of scouts.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody’s fame had reached the East long before,
and a great many New Yorkers went out to see
him and join in his buffalo hunts, including such men
as August Belmont, James Gordon Bennett, Anson
Stager, and J. G. Heckscher. In entertaining these
visitors at Fort McPherson, Cody was accustomed to
arrange wild-West exhibitions. In return his friends
invited him to visit New York. It was upon seeing his
first play in the metropolis that Cody conceived the idea
of going into the show business.</p>

<p>Assisted by Ned Buntline, novelist, and Colonel Ingraham,
he started his “Wild West” show, which later
developed and expanded into “<ins class="corr" id="tn2" title="Transcriber’s Note—“A Congress of the Rough-riders of the World” changed to “A Congress of the Rough Riders of the World”.">A Congress of the Rough Riders of the World</ins>,”
first presented at Omaha, Nebraska. In time it became a familiar
yearly entertainment in the great cities of this country and Europe.
Many famous personages attended the performances, and became his warm
friends, including Mr. Gladstone, the Marquis of Lorne, King Edward,
Queen Victoria, and the Prince of Wales, now King of England.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Sioux, in 1890 and 1891,
Colonel Cody served at the head of the Nebraska National
Guard. In 1895 Cody took up the development
of Wyoming Valley by introducing irrigation. Not long
afterward he became judge advocate general of the
Wyoming National Guard.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill) died in Denver, Colorado,
on January 10, 1917. His legacy to a grateful world was
a large share in the development of the West, and a
multitude of achievements in horsemanship, marksmanship,
and endurance that will live for ages. His life
will continue to be a leading example of the manliness,
courage, and devotion to duty that belonged to a picturesque
phase of American life now passed, like the great
patriot whose career it typified, into the Great Beyond.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill drew rein and looked around. He was
in a narrow and lonely trail that ran close by the
Cinnabar River.</p>

<p>The country was gullied and cut by small cañons.
Several hundred feet below him the river roared in
its narrow, rock-bound bed. On the sloping side of
this cañon was a number of trees, some of them of
large size; and trees of the same kind bordered the
trail.</p>

<p>The scout, having drawn rein, sat quite still in his
saddle, listening. All he heard now was the roar of
the stream, the soughing of the wind in the trees, and
the restless champing of his spirited horse.</p>

<p>“Help!”</p>

<p>A sudden cry of distress sounded near him, and
once more Buffalo Bill stared around.</p>

<p>The call seemed to have come out of the sky, or
to have floated from the mist that rose above the tumbling
water of the river.</p>

<p>“Can my ears have fooled me?” was his thought.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he called. “What is it?”</p>

<p>A faint mumbling seemed to come in answer to this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
but he could not locate the sound nor distinguish the
words.</p>

<p>He rode up and down the trail, looking over into
the cañon and along its timbered slope; he let his eyes
wander over the rocky hillsides opposite the cañon.</p>

<p>“The wind is fooling me!” was his thought. Yet
he was not satisfied to let it go at that; so he dismounted,
tied his horse, and swung down the incline
of the cañon for a number of yards, and there reaching
a shelf of rock, he bent over the river and listened.
Then he heard it again&mdash;a cry for help.</p>

<p>This time it seemed to be above him, almost over
his head; and it sounded so startlingly clear that he
could have fancied that the lips that made it were at
his elbow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, starting up and staring around.
“Where are you? I see no one.”</p>

<p>The call rose louder and clearer, so clear that it was
absolutely startling. Apparently, the one making the
cry had, for the first time, become aware that the call
for help had reached human ears.</p>

<p>“Here I am, right here! Help! I’m right here&mdash;in
this tree!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill rose to his feet and stared hard at the
tree before him. It was within six yards of him,
higher up toward the level where lay the trail; and the
voice had seemed to come from the heart of it. Yet
he could see no hole in the tree.</p>

<p>It was a large, stubby oak, wide branching and
low; its thick boughs extended along the cañon slope,
forming there a massy shade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>“Yes!” he said, jumping toward it. “In the tree?
Where?”</p>

<p>The voice seemed now to gurgle, and again the answer
was so indistinct that Buffalo Bill climbed up to
the tree, and walked around it, determined to find an
opening, if there was one.</p>

<p>“In the tree?” he asked. “In this tree?”</p>

<p>He kicked on it and hammered on it with his
knuckles.</p>

<p>“Yes!” the voice now screamed, seeming to be right
before him. “I’m&mdash;fast&mdash;in&mdash;this&mdash;consarned&mdash;tree!
Help! H-e-l-p! H-e-l-p!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” said the scout again, shouting the word.
“How did you get in? And how can I reach you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;fell&mdash;in! Help! H-e-l-p! H-e-l-p!”</p>

<p>“Fell in? How? When&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fell in at the top, you fool! Help! H-e-l-p!
H-e-l-p!”</p>

<p>The voice had a strange, quavering sound, high-keyed
and singular.</p>

<p>“Fell in from the top!” The scout looked at the
thick top of the tree. “Well, this must be investigated!”</p>

<p>He began to climb the tree, using his lariat to aid
him, looping it around the tree and around his body,
thus assisting himself materially in making the ascent.
He climbed rapidly in this way, and was soon in the
lower branches.</p>

<p>The voice continued to call, sometimes sounding
loud and clear, and then almost falling, or seeming to
fall, to shrill whispers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p>He fancied these changes were due to the wind
that roared through the top of the tree, carrying the
sound first one way and then another.</p>

<p>In a very short time he was in the matted top of the
oak, hanging over the cañon. Then, to his amazement,
he saw before him a large hole, such as a bear
might have used. The calls were coming from this
hole.</p>

<p>He looked into it, but the hole was black as pitch,
and he could see nothing. However, the words of the
person down in it seemed now to be shot at him as
if from the muzzle of a gun.</p>

<p>“Help! H-e-l-p! H-e-l-p! I’m in the tree; and
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes! I’m here to help you. How far down
are you? I can’t see you.”</p>

<p>“Something’s stoppin’ up the hole now; it’s a bear
mebbe! Help! H-e-l-p!”</p>

<p>“I am shutting the light out, I suppose. I want to
help you. If I lower my lariat can you get hold of
it? Then perhaps I can pull you out, or assist you
to get out.”</p>

<p>The calls changed in their character; the person in
the tree had become aware that some one was at the
opening, and that this some one was proffering assistance.</p>

<p>“Drap yer rope, then!” the voice shrieked. “I kin
climb it, mebbe.”</p>

<p>The scout lowered the noose end of his lariat into
the hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>“Just place the noose under your arms,” he instructed,
“and I can help you out.”</p>

<p>He felt the rope jerked, and then the voice shouted:</p>

<p>“All O. K. down here; now h’ist away. You’re a
stranger, but a friend in need; and a friend in need is
wuth a dozen angels any day o’ the week!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill began to haul on the rope, and was instantly
aware that the individual in the tree was
ascending. There was much scratching, sputtering,
and fussing, and many singular exclamations; but
slowly the tree prisoner ascended. Then the scout
beheld the top of a head, surmounted by a queer hat,
or bonnet; so that, at that first glance, he thought he
had an Indian in the loop of the lariat.</p>

<p>However, when the neck and shoulders, and then
the body of the prisoner appeared, he saw that he
had drawn a woman out of the tree.</p>

<p>The fact was amazing, and this woman was as
singular a creature as he had ever seen: being a tall,
raw-boned, awkward female, with a vinegary countenance,
and features as homely as if they had been
copied from some comic monthly.</p>

<p>“Hello!” she sputtered, as she clutched the edge of
the hole and began to draw herself out. “This here
is what I calls an unfort’nit condition fer a lady to be
in. B’ jings, it is! An’ I reckon I’ve et a peck o’
dirt and rotten wood, into the barg’in!” She spat
pieces of wood out of her mouth, revealing a row of
fanglike teeth. “And I’ve that mussed up my Sunday
clo’es that I won’t be able to go to church nex’
Sunday!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>At this she cackled in a strange way, as if she had
uttered a good joke.</p>

<p>With the scout’s assistance, she crawled out of the
hole and dropped down in the nest of broad limbs
that were matted together in front of the hole, forming
there a sort of shelf of verdure.</p>

<p>“Well, may I be switched if I was ever in sich a
reedicklus situation before!” she grumbled. “I reckon
you never before pulled a lady out o’ the top of a
tree?”</p>

<p>The scout was staring at her most ungallantly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” he admitted. “I must beg your pardon
if I was rough while hauling on that rope.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t as light as swan’s-down!” she cackled.
“I’m purty hefty; and heftier still when I git my mad
up and git in a fight.”</p>

<p>“But how did you get in such a place?” he was
forced to demand.</p>

<p>“I fell in.”</p>

<p>“Fell in?”</p>

<p>“You kin understand words, can’t ye? Yes, I fell
in.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I clim’ up here last night, thinkin’ it’d be a
safer place to spend the night in than down on the
ground, with wolves howlin’ ’round, and mebbe road
agents perambulatin’ along the trail. It looked like a
good sort of a nest up here, and I thought I’d try it
fer safety; fer I cal’lated that if a wild cat, er a
panther, got into the tree, I could git down, mebbe;
and I wasn’t as afeard o’ them as I was o’ the wolves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
I heerd howlin’. And so I clim’ up. And while
mussin’ ’round here on these limbs, tryin’ to make myself
comfortable, I slipped into that hole, hurtin’ my
arm some; and then, fust thing I knowed, I was down
in the holler of the tree inside, and couldn’t git out
ag’in.”</p>

<p>She laughed in a mirthless way.</p>

<p>“Well, you better believe that I was scai’t some,
when I found I couldn’t git out. I wiggled and I
waggled, but it didn’t do no good; and there I had
to stay.”</p>

<p>She laughed again, with that singular, mirthless
cackle.</p>

<p>“Well, I was safe enough from wolves and varmints
of that kind; you’d better believe I was. I didn’t
hear a wolf, ner did a single wild cat er panther try
to pay me a visit; but when mornin’ come I couldn’t
git out.</p>

<p>“I reckon I hollered so much that if the breath I
wasted doin’ it was all collected, it’d fill the sails of the
British navy. But it didn’t do a mite o’ good, seemed
like, till bime-by I reckon you heerd me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard you. Your yells were enough to wake
the dead!”</p>

<p>She glanced down into the hole and shivered.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’ll permit me, I’ll try to help you down
to the ground,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, law, I kin make that all right; that don’t trouble
me a little bit!”</p>

<p>To show that it did not, she swung down from the
nest of branches, and then, grappling the tree as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
she were a man, she slid down to the ground. The
scout followed her, and soon stood beside her on the
shelving slope.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll help you up to the trail,” he said. “You
must be pretty well exhausted by this time, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lawk, I don’t need no help!”</p>

<p>She began to scramble up to the trail.</p>

<p>The scout accompanied her, assisting her as much
as she would let him; and soon they stood together in
the trail.</p>

<span class="fs70">PIZEN JANE, OF CINNABAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Having arrived at a position in the trail, Buffalo Bill
looked more carefully at the woman rescued from her
strange prison in the hollow oak overhanging the
cañon of the river.</p>

<p>The woman looked as intently at him, with black
eyes that snapped and burned. She inspected him
from top to toe, critically, as if trying to size him up
and determine what character of man he was. Then
a sudden fiery wrath blazed in her black eyes, her lips
became pinched, and then opened in one of her strange
cackles.</p>

<p>“I guess,” she snapped, “that you’re the man that’s
playin’ the fake Buffler Bill trick about here. And if
ye aire, then I dunno but I’d ruther been left in the
tree than to have been helped by ye. Aire you him, er
ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill could not repress a smile at her manner.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the pleasure of knowing who this fake
Buffalo Bill is, but I assure you that I am the real
Buffalo Bill,” he said. “My name is Cody, as, perhaps,
you have heard, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She cackled again, scoffing at his declaration.</p>

<p>“What’s the proof of it?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I shall not try to present any proof, other than my
word.”</p>

<p>“And if you’re the fake Buffler, yer word ain’t good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
furder’n a man could sling a steer by the tail. You
ain’t the fake Buffler?”</p>

<p>“No, madam, I am not.”</p>

<p>“Why do ye call me madam, and how’d ye know I
ever was married, to desarve that title? Simply because
I’m oldish and have lost my good looks? You
don’t know me?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the honor.”</p>

<p>He touched his hat again, but a smile disturbed the
gravity of his face.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Pizen Jane, frum Cinnabar. Never
heerd o’ me?”</p>

<p>“I never had the honor to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shucks! Don’t be so perlite. Perliteness is due,
mebbe, to young girls with red cheeks and yaller hair,
and eyes that keeps rollin’ at the men; but it don’t
b’long in talkin’ to a woman like me, that’s seen the
world, and had all her beauty knocked off her long
ago.”</p>

<p>“I only meant&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t <em>mean</em>, then, when speakin’ to me; jes’ <em>speak</em>
yer thoughts. I know I’m homely, and my temper
ain’t any purtier than my face. I’m Pizen Jane, of
Cinnabar.”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to know you, and wish to assure you
again that I am William F. Cody, known to many as
Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ the same, I’m goin’ to watch ye!”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of you.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say by that it ain’t kind o’ me, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
you yankin’ me outer that hole? Well, I thank you
fer that. Where you goin’?”</p>

<p>“I was on my way from Cinnabar.”</p>

<p>“Yisterday I was, too; but I got stuck in that hole,
and that brought my journeyin’ to a close. I reckon,
if you’re goin’ on, I’ll go with ye. You’ve got a hoss
there.”</p>

<p>“A very good animal.”</p>

<p>“Glad of it; fer I’m goin’ to ride behind ye on that
hoss. I don’t reckon you’ve got anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have food in my saddle pouches. I will get
it for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m that hungry I could eat sawdust! Fer, ye see,
I didn’t have any supper las’ night, an’ no breakfast
this mornin’. If ’twasn’t so fur, I’d git down to that
river and git me a drink.”</p>

<p>“I have a water bottle, which you’re welcome to.”</p>

<p>“Law suz, you’re a reg’lar travelin’ hotel! Well,
I’m glad of it; fer I’m that hungry and dry that I
can’t think straight. When I git somethin’ to eat and
drink, I’ll try to see if my hat is on straight, and if
my clothes sets right. Shouldn’t wonder if they don’t,
sense my experience in that tree.”</p>

<p>She continued to talk while he procured the food
and the water; and then she sat down on the ground
and devoured the things he gave her. While doing
it she now and then looked at him, with covert glances,
and now and then she mumbled, as if talking to herself.</p>

<p>The scout was undeniably puzzled by this woman.
In his experience on the border he had encountered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
many strange characters. Sometimes he had found
that their eccentricity was assumed as a mask and
covered some hidden design, or concealed a scoundrelly
and criminal past. In a few cases he had found
that an assumed eccentricity concealed an officer of the
law, who was masked in that way for detective work.</p>

<p>After brushing the crumbs out of her lap in a
thoughtful manner, she looked up.</p>

<p>“Was you tellin’ me the truth when you said you
was the ginuine Buffalo Bill?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but the truth,” he answered.</p>

<p>Her face still showed doubt.</p>

<p>“Lemme ask ye another question er two.”</p>

<p>“As many as you like.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a wuthless critter named
Pete Sanborn?”</p>

<p>“I never did.”</p>

<p>“He used to run a little hash house down at Cinnabar,
only he was too lazy to run it, and his wife done
the work. He liked to gamble better than he did to
work, and he’d ruther pick a man’s pockets than to
git money in any other way.”</p>

<p>“A fellow to keep away from.”</p>

<p>“Well, he was. I knowed him to my sorrow. He
done things lately a good deal wuss’n any of them
things. I hope vigilantes will git him, and finish him.”</p>

<p>Her blackened and straggling teeth came together
with a vindictive click.</p>

<p>“And you never,” she went on, “heerd of a young
feller called Pool Clayton? His reg’lar name was
Bruce, but he played pool and billiards so much that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the fellers got to callin’ him Pool; and I reckon it fit
him, fer the name stuck. He’s a young man, not much
more’n a boy, and I think he knowed you!”</p>

<p>The final sentence she shot at the scout as if it were
an accusation.</p>

<p>“I never happened to meet him, so far as my knowledge
goes.”</p>

<p>“He’s a young man, and rather good lookin’; more
weak than really mean, I should say; and goin’ to the
dogs fast, last accounts I had of him.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of him.”</p>

<p>She brushed her lap again, as if there were more
crumbs in it, and looked down, as if taking time to
gather her thoughts, or think of more questions.
Finally she rose, shaking out her skirt.</p>

<p>“Now, if you don’t ’bject, I’d like fer ye to give me
a lift on yer hoss, if he’ll kerry double. It’s askin’ a
good deal, I know, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall be happy to let you ride on my horse, and
I will walk; or you may mount behind my saddle, if
that pleases you.”</p>

<p>She laughed then, cackling out in the manner that
had first attracted him. It was not musical, nor even
suggestive of good humor, though the woman apparently
meant that it should suggest the last.</p>

<p>“I’m Pizen Jane, of Cinnabar,” she said again, “and
I hope you won’t rue the day when you fust met me.
You won’t, if you’re straight. But if you’re not reelly
Buffler Bill, but the fake that mebbe ye aire, you’ll
not think meetin’ me was good fer yer health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>Then she seemed to feel that this was harsh, when
the things he had done for her were considered.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’d ought to beg yer pardon,” she said
apologetically. “If I say things you don’t like, fergit
’em. I’m loose-jawed, and my tongue wags sometimes
like a splinter in a windstorm. But if you understood
the things that’s made me what I am, you
wouldn’t think it a mite strange if I was tryin’ to shoot
yer head off, instead of talkin’ ca’m to you. You desarve
it, if the things I’ve heerd about ye aire true.”</p>

<p>“I hope to merit your good opinion,” said the scout,
much amused by the freedom with which she
“wagged” her tongue.</p>

<p>“You’ll git it, if ye desarve it; and if ye don’t desarve
it, then you’ll git what you do desarve; and
don’t you fail to recklect that! Fer I’m Pizen Jane,
of Cinnabar.”</p>

<p>“It seems a strange name,” he said, bringing up his
horse.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Pizen, to some people, ’cause I stand fer
my rights and don’t let nobody tromp on me. I’m
Pizen to men who don’t do right, you bet! And I’ll
tell ye now, what mebbe I’d ought to keep to myself,
that I’m on the warpath, and that I’m standin’ ready to
shoot full of holes a certain man as soon as I meet
him. Rejoice that you ain’t him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem so very warlike,” said the scout,
smiling at her. “I don’t mind telling you that.”</p>

<p>“That’s a compliment, I s’pose? Well, I don’t desarve
it.” She looked the horse over critically. “Aire
you goin’ right on through the mountains?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s nigh two days’ journey!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it.”</p>

<p>“And this trail is filled with road agents, they say;
road agents that lay fer everything that comes along,
and shoots men as if they wasn’t more than wolves.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a dangerous trail.”</p>

<p>“What if you’re held up?”</p>

<p>“I shall defend myself; but I’m trusting not to be.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I can trust ye; and if I can’t trust ye I
can watch ye. Hold the hoss’ head, and I’ll sail up
to his back.”</p>

<p>The scout held the horse by the head, and with an
agility that was surprising, disdaining his aid, she put
a foot in the stirrup and mounted to the animal’s back,
seating herself behind the saddle.</p>

<p>“I’m spryer’n I look,” she said, “otherwise I couldn’t
got into that tree where ye found me. Now, if you’ll
mount, we’ll jog along, and you can tell me more
about yerself while we’re goin’. I’ll say to you that
Pizen Jane, of Cinnabar, is searchin’ fer somebody she
hopes to find; and if she finds him, interestin’ times aire
billed to foller fer all concerned. That’s why I’m on
this trail; what you’re on it fur ain’t appeared yit, so
fur as I know.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill mounted, smiling at the woman’s naïve
manner of trying to “pump” him.</p>

<p>Then they jogged on, as quaint a pair as the trail
had seen in many a day.</p>

<span class="fs70">CHASED BY WOLVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Because of the intense midsummer heat in that
desert region, Buffalo Bill did not journey far that
morning, but relieved his horse of its double burden
long before noon, and took shelter from the burning
sun in the shady depths of the cañon, at a point where
its sides were scalable for man and beast.</p>

<p>Pizen Jane seemed impervious to the heat, and declared
her anxiety to go on. But she descended into
the cañon, and there helped the scout eat the food
which remained after her famine feast of the morning.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey, and now, as she and the
scout rested, she asked strange questions without number,
all tending to show that she still did not believe
he was the man he represented himself to be.</p>

<p>What her own intentions and plans were she
cloaked with much cleverness, though she talked all
around the subject, drowning it in a very sea of words.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill gained the idea, however, that she had
suffered some wrong at the hands of some man, or
men, or that some bitter grief and disappointment had
come to her; for the avenging, or righting, of which
she had set forth alone on this dangerous trail. In
addition, it seemed that she suspected him of being in
some manner concerned in the wrong done her, and
that she had proofs of it she more than once hinted.</p>

<p>“I begin to fear you are crazy, madam,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
at length, when she had vexed him with her many
hints of personal wrongdoing. “But please remember
that I never met you before, and know absolutely nothing
of any of the men you so veiledly speak of. I
might know more, if you would be more open in what
you say.”</p>

<p>“And then you’d know too much, if you ain’t the
reel Buffler!” she cackled. “Pizen Jane may be
homely lookin’, and no doubt she is, but she ain’t no
fool.”</p>

<p>They did not go on until the cool shadows of evening
covered the trail. They continued the journey far
into the night, going forward by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>The hour was late, when Pizen Jane gave a convulsive
leap, and threw her arms around the scout’s body,
with a quick motion.</p>

<p>“Did ye hear that?” she asked breathless.</p>

<p>The scout drew rein.</p>

<p>“I heard nothing,” said he. “What did you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There it is ag’in! Wolves, as I’m a mortal sinner!
And they’re answering each other, I’ll be bound.
Jes’ listen at ’em!”</p>

<p>The scout could not fail to hear them now, for their
howls swept out in a wild chorus.</p>

<p>“Wolves?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Comin’ this way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>She observed that in spite of his careless reply he
touched up the horse with the spur.</p>

<p>The wolves were in two bands, apparently; one band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
on the mountainside, off on the left, and the other behind,
in the trail, or in the river cañon. Those on
the hillside were nearest, and their howls soon became
frightful.</p>

<p>“Chasin’ us?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll hope not.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know they aire! Ye can’t fool me. I’ve
had experience. This ain’t the fust time I’ve heerd
’em.”</p>

<p>She put her hand into her bosom and drew out a
revolver.</p>

<p>“This ain’t big enough to kill many wolves with,”
she remarked; “but it’s big enough to kill me, which
it’ll do if the wolves should seem about to git me. I’d
ruther die by a bullet than to have them critters tear
me into giblets. Ugh! Hear ’em yellin’!”</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant sound, and again the scout
touched the horse up with the spur.</p>

<p>The country lay more open before him, a fact of
which he was glad. The moonlight and open country
lessened the danger from the wolves; for, like all evil
creatures, they loved the darkness rather than the
light.</p>

<p>The horse was now flying along, oblivious of its
double burden. It not only heard the wolves, but had
scented them, and was frightened.</p>

<p>The howling drew nearer, and soon the wolves,
sweeping down from the hills, were seen running along
the trail just behind the fugitives, and off on the left,
beyond revolver shot. They grew constantly bolder
and bolder, so that soon they were close upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
horse. They seemed to recognize the helplessness of
the fugitives, pitted against so many; for the wolf
gains courage from numbers, and is boldest when in
big packs.</p>

<p>Soon the wolves became so reckless that they dashed
into the trail, partly surrounding the horse. Then
they began to leap at its nose, and sought to strike
their teeth into its legs for the purpose of hamstringing
it, after the manner in which they were accustomed
to bring down deer and other game.</p>

<p>The scout shot one that sprang at the horse’s head;
and then dropped another that had leaped to the
horse’s haunches.</p>

<p>“Downed ’em, ye did!” cried Pizen Jane. “Good
for you! It makes me ’most love ye, Buffler, to see
you drop ’em like that.”</p>

<p>He made no answer save a grunt of wrath.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” Pizen Jane cackled, “I know you’re enj’yin’
my society, even if the wolves is chasin’ us!”</p>

<p>“I should feel better if you were not here,” he answered,
quite frankly.</p>

<p>“Why, Buffler?”</p>

<p>“Because of the wolves. You have no need to ask.”</p>

<p>He fired at another.</p>

<p>It fell with a yelp, being only wounded; but immediately
its ferocious comrades sprang on it, tearing it
to pieces almost instantly, being rendered savage beyond
belief by the scent of its flowing blood.</p>

<p>Even the bold scout shuddered as he saw that. He
had seen its like more than once, yet it never failed
to impress him with a sense of the awful ferocity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
wolves when maddened in that way, and of his terrible
peril. He knew that if his horse fell, or if either
of the riders should be thrown to the ground, a horrible
death could only result.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” said Pizen Jane at length, as he brought
down another wolf, thus feeding it to its comrades, “I
know this trail, havin’ been over it before, and you
don’t know it; but there’s a ford right ahead, where
the trail dips down and then crosses the river. If you
can reach that ford, you can git in the water there and
make a stand agin’ ’em wuth while. They’ll git us,
otherwise.”</p>

<p>She did not emit that cackling laugh now; in fact,
she had begun to appreciate her horrible danger, and
was speculating as to its outcome.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven for that!” said the scout. “Perhaps
I can hold them off until the ford is reached.”</p>

<p>He had fired every cartridge out of his revolver,
and now drew another.</p>

<p>“Can you reload this one?” he said, passing it back
to her, with some cartridges.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “and shoot it, too!”</p>

<p>She proceeded to show that she could, by bringing
down a wolf that tried to leap upon the horse,
close by her. The claws of the wolf struck through
the thick hide of the horse just as she fired, and, contracting
in a death clutch, they raked the skin open,
so that blood flowed.</p>

<p>The horse gave a jump that came nigh hurling Pizen
Jane to the ground; but she threw her arms round the
scout and held on like grim death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>A dozen wolves had leaped on the one she shot, and
were rending and devouring it; but others came on,
more frantically determined than ever to pull down the
horse, now, that they scented the hot blood which
streamed from its flank.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill brought down one of the pursuing
wolves, and Pizen Jane another.</p>

<p>Though the living ones stopped to rend the dead
and dying, the delay was brief enough.</p>

<p>Yet it enabled the sorely pressed horse to gain on
its fiendish foes.</p>

<p>“The ford’s jist ahead of ye now!” Pizen Jane
screamed in the ear of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>In another minute he saw before him the darkly
flowing waters of the river, which had emerged from
its cañon bed and here flowed through a quiet landscape.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill spurred the frantic and terrified horse
into the river until the water came up over the girth.</p>

<p>“Draw up your feet,” he said to Pizen Jane.</p>

<p>“I ain’t neither sugar ner salt, to be melted away
by a little water,” she declared; “and I dunno but I
could swim if I was driv’ to it; so don’t worry about
me. Jist so we git out o’ reach o’ them screechin’ varmints,
is all I ask.”</p>

<p>The pursuing and infuriated wolves dashed up to
the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill turned in the saddle and dropped one
of them by a well-directed shot, and then wounded
another.</p>

<p>The ferocious survivors began to tear at the fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
wolves as soon as they were down, so that within a
few minutes nothing was left of them but shining, dislocated
bones. The sight was enough to make the
scout and the woman shudder.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill urged the horse still farther out into
the river, until the water stood midway of its sides.</p>

<p>The wolves on the shore seemed, within a few minutes,
to number scores, and even hundreds. Their
snapping teeth, fiery eyes, and struggling movements
made the shore a writhing mass of fiendish forms.
Some of them dashed into the water and began to
swim out to the horse; but they were at a disadvantage
in the water; for they could not there make the tremendous
leaps that would carry them to the horse’s
back, nor could they move quickly enough to baffle the
revolver fire of the scout and Pizen Jane.</p>

<p>Pizen Jane was reloading and firing the revolver
the scout had given her, with a coolness and courage
that would have befitted a man.</p>

<p>Between them they succeeded in shooting every
wolf that swam close to the horse.</p>

<p>The dark bodies of dead wolves bobbed in the
stream below the ford, where there were some eddies,
that, catching them, whirled them slowly round and
round.</p>

<p>But the fate of the wolves already slain had small
deterrent effect on those still living, and their numbers
seemed inexhaustible. Where they came from could
hardly be told; they seemed to spring out of the very
ground; and they ran snapping and yelping along the
banks, on both sides of the river now, while at intervals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
a few of the most desperate plunged in and
tried to reach the horse and its riders.</p>

<p>Generous as his supply of ammunition was, Buffalo
Bill began to fear it would soon be exhausted.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while the wolves still raved on the shores
of the moonlit river, and dashed into the water in efforts
to reach the horse, a wild scream was heard near
by, which had on them a marvelous effect. It was the
scream of a panther. The big beast had scented the
flowing blood, and doubtless had come for a feast.</p>

<p>The leaping forms of the wolves dropped out of
sight with almost startling suddenness, as the lithe
body of the panther came down the hillside with
springing leaps.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” cried Pizen Jane, with an almost hysterical
cackle. “The painter has druv ’em off.”</p>

<p>The “painter,” as she called the panther, came on toward
the river, not at first seeing the horse midway
of the stream. In another moment it would have been
cracking the bones of the dead wolves, if the horse
had not been startled by its coming and began to plunge
in the water, making a good deal of noise.</p>

<p>The panther stopped, throwing up its head and looking
down at the horse. It was startled, and seemed
too surprised for a moment to move. Then, with a
quick leap, it turned aside; and in another instant it,
too, was lost to sight in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Pizen Jane mumbled.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill saw now that she was trembling, as if
her nerves were exhausted.</p>

<p>“Shall we ride out now?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p>Before she could answer, the sharp report of a revolver,
or rifle, sounded. It was some distance away;
yet the stillness which had followed the cessation of
the wolf attack made it possible for sounds to carry
a long distance. Following the first shot, came others
in quick succession.</p>

<p>“Some other pore critter attacked by them varmints!”
Pizen Jane interpreted.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t git him, if he’s honest and hon’rable;
I hope he’s nigh to the water, and can git into it,
as we did.”</p>

<p>The scout was listening for a repetition of the shots.</p>

<p>“I hope a painter will come ’long to his ’sistance, as
it did to ours.”</p>

<p>The shots did not sound again.</p>

<p>“They’ve killed him, er he’s druv ’em away, er
mebbe the painter skeered ’em. I’m swearin’ by painters,
frum this time on!”</p>

<p>Pizen Jane’s tongue would wag, no matter what
happened.</p>

<p>“If I thought we could aid him, and he needed aid
now, I’d try to go to his help,” said the generous
scout.</p>

<p>“But we don’t know where he is!”</p>

<p>“He’s out in that direction, somewhere.”</p>

<p>“And he may be a road agent, or even an Injun.
More likely to be, than an honest man.”</p>

<p>“Very true; yet I shouldn’t want any human being
to be torn alive by wolves.”</p>

<p>“It’d serve some of ’em right,” avowed Pizen Jane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
with a grimness that was not pleasant. “Some on
’em that I know of, and am lookin’ fer, ought to be
chopped into giblets. If the wolves should kill ’em,
it’d save me the crime of murder when I meet ’em.”</p>

<p>When the shots did not come again, and nothing
occurred to indicate who the man was, or what had
happened to him, the scout abandoned his desire to
go to his aid.</p>

<p>He feared the return of the wolves; and so he kept
his horse in the stream, though the beast was soon
shaking from the chill of the cold water.</p>

<p>“It’s a tarnal queer thing, Buffler, ther way that animiles
do,” averred the woman, dropping into a mood
of philosophy. “The wolves warn’t afeared of us,
even when we laid ’em out on the shore like chopped
corn, though they was skeered o’ that painter; and the
painter that wasn’t afeared of the wolves, was afeared
of us. Varmints aire that queer there’s no knowin’
what to expect of ’em.”</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the scout kept his shivering horse
in the stream; but when it was seen that the wolves
were not likely to return soon he rode out of the
water.</p>

<p>On the shore he went into camp, and there he built
a fire. The fire would help to keep the wolves at
bay; and also it was needed to enable him and Pizen
Jane to dry their wet clothing.</p>

<p>He screened the fire as well as he could; yet he
knew it might be seen; and he was in a land where he
could expect to meet enemies in human shape as terrible
as the wolves and as little given to mercy. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
guard against surprise, he for a time stood in the
darkness beyond the rim of the firelight, watching
there, while the woman by the fire dried and warmed
herself.</p>

<p>Far away he heard wolves howling, and they may
have been some of those who had pursued him; but the
man who had fired the shots did not make himself
known.</p>

<p>The stars and the moon swung their slow way westward,
and the night grew late. At last the scout returned
to the fire, fed it with wood, and sat down.</p>

<p>Pizen Jane had fallen asleep, but his return aroused
her, and she raised herself on her elbow.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” she said, smoothing back her tangled
hair, “what aire ye goin’ to do now?”</p>

<p>“In what way?” he asked. “When?”</p>

<p>“Why, to-morrer?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know you’re lookin’ fer road agents!”</p>

<p>“You seem to think you are a mind reader,” he declared,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I am. I kin read yer mind same’s my own.”</p>

<p>“What am I thinking of?”</p>

<p>“That you wish Pizen Jane was in purgatory, er
some other furrin country!”</p>

<p>He laughed again, and she laughed with him.</p>

<p>“Hardly that, of course.”</p>

<p>“You’re wishin’ I wasn’t with you?”</p>

<p>“Your society is very pleasant,” was his gallant
statement; “but you will admit that this is hardly the
sort of country where a woman can feel safe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<p>“And that’s why I’m goin’ to hang to ye. You
can’t git rid of me. I’ll cling to ye like the bark on
a tree, and you can’t help it. Fer, ye see, you’re
huntin’ road agents, and so am I. And if you find
’em, and I’m with ye, why, I’ll find ’em, too. And
that’s what I want.”</p>

<p>He smiled into the firelight.</p>

<p>“I thought you were of the opinion that I was a
fake, and you meant to cling to me for the purpose
of finding out?”</p>

<p>“Well, that is one reason,” she admitted, with blunt
frankness. “If you ain’t the reel Buffler Bill, why, I
want to know that, too. And then I’ll be makin’ things
mighty int’restin’ fer ye.”</p>

<p>She laughed again, sliding from her stern grimness
and threatening into laughing good humor.</p>

<p>“I’ll watch a while, if ye want to sleep,” she said.
“I’ve had my forty winks, and can git along now till
morning.”</p>

<p>The scout felt sure that he could trust this woman
not to harm him in his sleep. She still mystified him,
and he could not yet fathom her purpose in being
there; for he did not credit her with all the motives
she professed. However, he trusted her, and so after
a while he lay down for a time, leaving Pizen Jane
on guard by the dying camp fire.</p>

<p>The horse was picketed on its lariat a few yards
away, and was certain to give an alarm if wolves or
other wild animals approached.</p>

<span class="fs70">A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the morning Buffalo Bill shot a jack rabbit, and
they breakfasted on that. Bones of wolves on the opposite
shore gave evidence of the terrible night battle
with those creatures.</p>

<p>To the woman it seemed almost a horrible dream,
and not a reality, with the sun now shining brightly,
and not a wolf or other harmful beast in sight.</p>

<p>“I feel as good as new,” she said, in her queer way;
“only a bit stiff in the j’ints.” She walked along the
river for exercise. “Now what ye goin’ to do?” she
asked, coming back, while the scout watered his horse
at the stream.</p>

<p>“I’m going first to the point where those shots
sounded in the night.”</p>

<p>“D’ye reckon ye can find it?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I located the direction pretty accurately.”</p>

<p>“But you couldn’t tell how fur they was off.”</p>

<p>“No; but if we get the direction and keep going
we’ll come to the place, by and by.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s so, too. I s’pose you’re wishin’ I’d go
back to the town this mornin’?”</p>

<p>“Not since you said you didn’t intend to.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her. She interested him, and he was
still studying her, trying to determine her character
and what she really meant by thus clinging to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m goin’ to hang to ye; and if you should
say I couldn’t, I’d go anyhow. I think I’m takin’ a
fancy to yer. If I was a younger woman now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I think I’d try to marry ye, if I found out you was
what ye pretend to be, and honest.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me,” he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Do I? Well, I don’t mean it.”</p>

<p>He helped her to the back of his horse, though she
said she needed no assistance; and they rode on again,
going now in the direction of those mysterious shots.</p>

<p>They had progressed a mile before Buffalo Bill
found what he was looking for&mdash;indications of the
presence of men.</p>

<p>Hoofprints of horses showed, and the tracks of
men, a considerable body of them. But the tracks
were nearly a day old, and could none of them have
been made by the man who fired the shots. There was,
too, the ashes of an old camp fire. Buffalo Bill inspected
that with considerable interest.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said, as he looked about. “Some one
came along after these men had left; and, finding this
old camp and the ashes, he built a new fire here; and
that was last night; and, whoever he was, he did the
shooting.”</p>

<p>“At wolves?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so; that seems the most likely guess.
Some of the wolves troubled him, and he shot at
them.”</p>

<p>He began to search beyond the limits of the camp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
hoping to find wolf tracks which would prove his
theory.</p>

<p>He stopped this search on observing a soil-stained
letter which had been stepped on by a horse, whose
hoofs had driven it into the earth, half-covering it.</p>

<p>He took it up and looked at it. To his astonishment,
the address side of the envelope bore the name of Nick
Nomad.</p>

<p>“Nomad!” he said, staring around as if he half expected
to see his old pard of the plains and mountains
rise out of the ground there. “Nomad! He
was here.”</p>

<p>He looked about; then took from the envelope the
letter it held; for the envelope had already been torn
open. It was merely a note, on some matter of business
of no importance.</p>

<p>“Nomad dropped it by chance. No; perhaps he
dropped it purposely.”</p>

<p>He began to search the ground closely.</p>

<p>“What ye found?” called Pizen Jane, who was
watching him.</p>

<p>“A letter from an old friend.”</p>

<p>“Funny kind of a post office to be gittin’ letters out
of!” she observed. “What’s it like?&mdash;a love letter?”</p>

<p>The scout ignored her question and went on with
his search.</p>

<p>He found wolf tracks out beyond the point where
the ground had been torn by the hoofs of horses, thus
establishing his belief that the man who had camped
alone there during the night had been troubled by the
wolves, and had fired upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder if that man could have been Nomad?”
was his thought. He dismissed it in a moment. “No;
Nomad is too wary to have gone on without inspecting
my camp by the river; and, if he had inspected it,
he would have discovered me and made himself
known.”</p>

<p>He searched again at the point where the letter had
been trampled into the soil. This examination convinced
him that the horse that had stepped on the letter
had been of the horses that were there two nights
before.</p>

<p>“Whoever the man was who did the shooting he
was not Nomad.”</p>

<p>After a while he returned to where the woman had
stood watching him.</p>

<p>“What ye found?” she demanded.</p>

<p>He showed her the letter.</p>

<p>“Nick Nomad is an old friend of mine. We have
hunted and trailed together more times than I can
tell you; and he’s true as steel. I thought at first
he did that shooting. But I’m convinced he did not.
A body of men camped here two nights ago; and at
that time, or before that time, Nomad was here, and
dropped this letter.”</p>

<p>“Some other man might have had it and dropped
it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so. Some other man might have
dropped it.”</p>

<p>“Road agents, mebbe. He might have been robbed,
and they may have tuck that letter from him, with
other things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>“You’re good at guessing,” the scout admitted.
“All of that may be true. I’m of the opinion the
large party camping here two nights ago were road
agents.”</p>

<p>“He might have j’ined ’em?”</p>

<p>“Impossible. What I’m afraid of is that he was
with them as a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Glory be! Ye don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“He’s shrewd; and if he was their prisoner he probably
dropped this letter, to let any one who found it
know the fact, or guess it. He doubtless had no chance
to write, or to drop anything else.”</p>

<p>“Road agents!” she said, looking about.</p>

<p>“And now your question of what I am going to do
is answered. I’m going to follow the trail of those
road agents, even if it is two days old.”</p>

<p>“And the man that camped here alone and done
that shootin’ last night?”</p>

<p>“He may have been a road agent, following on
their trail; and, if so, he is now riding on to overtake
them. We can tell better about that as we go on.”</p>

<p>“Or he may’ve been somebody follerin’ them, same
as I am, and you?”</p>

<p>“Very true.”</p>

<p>The scout, though anxious now to go on as fast as
possible, did not give over the search of this camping
spot until he was sure there was nothing unfound
that could aid him.</p>

<p>“Mebbe he’s one o’ the men I’m lookin’ fur,” said
Pizen Jane, as she mounted to go on. “I don’t reckon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
he is, though; ’twould be too much good luck. Luck
ain’t been rollin’ my way much lately.”</p>

<p>She cackled in her shrill fashion, as if she thought
she had said something funny.</p>

<p>No single trail was observed to leave the main trail,
as they went on.</p>

<p>By and by the scout became convinced that Nick
Nomad was a prisoner of a gang of outlaws, though
he had no solid proof on which to build this belief.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the fact that the letter had
been trampled into the ground, showing by that that
the horses had been there after it was dropped, he
might have thought Nomad had struck the outlaws’
trail, and was following them, for he knew that Nick
Nomad was in that country for the sole purpose of
running down the road agents and desperadoes that
infested it&mdash;the same mission that had brought him
there.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill talked of his beliefs and theories with
Pizen Jane, for he discovered that she possessed a
good fund of hard, common sense, and her judgments
were at times valuable.</p>

<p>She agreed with him, when he had pointed out the
hoofs, that Nick Nomad had not been following the
big trail; and, if that were so, then that he had either
been in advance of the outlaws or he was with them.
If with them, nothing was surer than that old Nomad
was a prisoner.</p>

<p>“We’ll follow this trail until we know the truth,”
said the scout.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” she cackled, “I’m with ye! Ye may think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
that is a joke, but ’tain’t; fer I mean that I’m with ye
in spirit, as well as otherwise. And mebbe you’ll allow
bimeby that Pizen Jane is a good deal better than she
looks, and has got more sense than any man would
guess, if he jedged by the way her tongue clacks.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE CAPTURE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Nomad, the old trapper and mountainman, had
received word from his famous pard, Buffalo Bill, informing
him that the latter intended to go into the
desert country that lay near the base of the Sepulcher
Mountains, for the purpose, if possible, of breaking up
the road-agent organization known to exist there.</p>

<p>The mountains of the gruesome name deserved the
title of Sepulcher. They were barren and forbidding,
and held so little water on their desert side that it
was as much as a man’s life was worth to get lost in
them there, for he was pretty certain to die of thirst.
Yet the Sepulcher Mountains held gold in paying quantities,
and that lure was drawing men from all quarters
of the country.</p>

<p>Gold is such a magnet that, no matter where it is,
men will go to get it, even under the arctic circle; and
if it could be certainly known that gold is at the north
pole, money would soon be found to equip expeditions
of such magnitude that the secret of even that hitherto
unassailable point would quickly be laid bare.</p>

<p>The miners and prospectors who were working in
the Sepulcher Mountains, and in the adjacent desert,
locally called Death Valley, had been shipping out a
good deal of gold, by the stages, and in other ways;
and on that gold road agents had been levying heavy
tolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<p>Yet, knowing this, Nick Nomad had been unaccountably
careless, after striking the trail leading into
the Sepulcher Mountains. He fancied that the road
agents confined their operations rather exclusively to
another trail, and to the other side of the mountains,
and to the trails that crisscrossed the desert. Hence,
he did not adopt his usual precautions. He went to
sleep in the open, with a fire burning, curling himself
up by it, and there enjoying his pipe in fancied security.</p>

<p>Near by grazed his horse, the famous old Nebuchadnezzar;
a horse whose apparent age and decrepitude
had to be discounted, or the beholder would be much
fooled in him; for, though it seemed that Nebuchadnezzar
had about outlived his usefulness and could run
no more than a turtle, the old beast was amazingly
swift, and also amazingly intelligent. So intelligent
was he that old Nick Nomad felt as safe, with Nebuchadnezzar
grazing close by, as if the horse had
been a trained watch dog sitting guard there.</p>

<p>However, even old Nebuchadnezzar grew sleepy
after a while, and lay down on the grass to rest. Being
tired that day, for he had journeyed far, he slept quite
as heavily as did his wearied master; so that, though
his ears were keen, trampling hoofs were almost upon
the camp before the fact was thudded by their hoofs
into his dull ears, arousing him.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar lifted his head then, and squealed
a warning, at the same time scrambling up and snorting
in alarm.</p>

<p>Nick Nomad opened his eyes, and bounded to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
feet with the agility of a man many years younger.
As he did so, he caught up his rifle, an ancient weapon,
and swung it round his head.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Nebby, consarn ye!” he grunted. “What’s
up?”</p>

<p>He knew on the instant. “Hands up!” came to him
out of the darkness, and he heard rifles clicking. Then
he saw dimly the figures of mounted men.</p>

<p>He ducked with lightning quickness, sliding across
the smoldering fire as he did so, trying thus to reach
Nebuchadnezzar. He whistled at the same time in
a shrill way, and the knowing beast came running toward
him, until stopped by the lariat.</p>

<p>The horse reached the end of the lariat with a jerk,
and stood snorting.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Nebby!”</p>

<p>In another minute Nick Nomad would have cut the
lariat and been on the back of the old horse; but a
rifle rang, and the bullet whistled past his face, making
its wind felt, it was so close.</p>

<p>Nomad stopped, then; not because he so much
feared for himself, as because he feared for the life
of Nebuchadnezzar. He knew that even in the darkness
those riflemen could see well enough to shoot
down the horse; he was sure they would do it if he
tried to get away on its back; and Nebuchadnezzar was
as dear to him as his own life. He faced around,
swinging his heavy rifle.</p>

<p>“By all ther spooks o’ ther hills, ef I don’t let daylight
through ye, ef ye shoot Nebby!” he yelled.
“’Ware thar, and don’t do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>A man was riding toward him, and at the man’s
heels came others.</p>

<p>“Hands up!”</p>

<p>“And drap my gun? Waal, ye don’t know me, if
ye think I’ll do it. Waugh!”</p>

<p>“Put down that gun!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, yes; and willin’, see ’t I can’t do
nothin’ else. But I shoots ther fust cuss thet lays a
hand in harm on my ole hoss.”</p>

<p>The man drew rein, and some of those behind him
snickered at Nomad’s words.</p>

<p>“Who aire ye?”</p>

<p>“Waugh! I’m a better man than ther critter that
asks ther question!”</p>

<p>“No foolishness! Hands up! And give your
name!”</p>

<p>One of the man’s followers, who had ridden near
enough to see Nomad, now announced the old trapper’s
name.</p>

<p>“Nick Nomad,” he said; “ther friend of Buffler
Bill! And may the devil roast him!”</p>

<p>“Put down yer gun!” the leader commanded.</p>

<p>The tone was so menacing that Nomad saw he must
comply, if he didn’t want to feel the lead of the outlaw’s
revolver. So he laid the old rifle on the ground,
though he did it with a sigh. Then he folded his
arms on his breast, and stood erect before the outlaws,
an impressive figure, in spite of his small stature,
wizened face, and his eccentric dress.</p>

<p>He was a typical trapper of the old time in appearance,
with his fringed and greasy leggings, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
hunting shirt of cloth and deerskin, and the round
beaver-skin cap on his head, the cap being as greasy
and soiled as his clothing.</p>

<p>“Now, what is it ye want of me?” he said; though
the manner in which the announcement of his name
had been received told him that these men were his
enemies; and he was sure they were road agents, the
very desperadoes he had come there to seek with his
old pard, Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>The men sprang from their saddles and surrounded
him.</p>

<p>Old Nebuchadnezzar backed from them to the end
of his picket rope, and snorted indignantly and fearfully.</p>

<p>“Aire you Nick Nomad, as he says?” demanded the
leader, peering into the trapper’s face.</p>

<p>Nomad fancied that lying would gain him nothing.</p>

<p>“Happy ter say thet I am,” he declared. “I reckon
it ain’t a name ter be ashamed on, along this hyar
border; seein’ thet Injuns and outlaws never yit liked
ther sound of it.”</p>

<p>“Give up yer weapons.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s my gun.”</p>

<p>“But yer other weapons&mdash;yer knife and pistols.”</p>

<p>“And then what?” the old man asked. “Mebbe
ye’ll be wantin’ me ter give up my life next?”</p>

<p>“Surrender yer weapons!” was shouted at him.</p>

<p>Nomad was driven to the conviction that this surrender
meant his death; but, if he was to die, he preferred
to do it in more heroic fashion than that.</p>

<p>He sprang from the ground, as the outlaw leader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
bent toward him; and his foot, catching the man under
the chin, hurled him back against the men behind him,
throwing them into sudden confusion.</p>

<p>Nomad, the next instant, was leaping away.</p>

<p>He did not run toward Nebuchadnezzar, preferring
to take the chances of bullets alone, so strongly did he
love his horse.</p>

<p>Bullets followed, whizzing through the air round his
head.</p>

<p>The outlaws jumped in chase of him, yelling like Indians.</p>

<p>Nomad stumbled, as he thus leaped along, and fell
to the ground.</p>

<p>It was a good thing for him; for bullets swept
through the air over the spot where he dropped, and
some of them would have struck him if he had remained
in an upright position.</p>

<p>He was trying to rise, when one of the outlaws
sprang on him, landing astride of his back, and almost
knocking the breath out of him. This outlaw threw
his arms round Nomad’s neck, and yelled for help;
and, other outlaws piling on him at once, the old man
was forced to submit.</p>

<p>When he had been tied, and sat helpless on the grass,
and the light of a hastily built camp fire illuminated
the scene, he stared quizzically into the face of the
infuriated leader, who stood now before him, boiling
with rage.</p>

<p>“If old Nebby once puts his foot in yer face,” said
Nomad, “man, you’ll know thet the little love tap
I handed ye wa’n’t jes’ nothin’ at all! And what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
would ye expect? Was I goin’ to stand still and let
ye kill me? You’ve got me now; and so I cal’late I
can’t help myself.”</p>

<p>Snaky Pete, for it was he, drew a knife.</p>

<p>“I’m tempted to slice ye into mince meat!” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t,” said Nomad coolly; “fer I’ll tell ye
right now that I’m too old and tough ter make good
mince meat out of.”</p>

<p>The man turned around, fierce in his manner as an
enraged grizzly.</p>

<p>“Where’s Pool Clayton?” he snarled.</p>

<p>A young man, a mere stripling, stepped forth from
the vociferating crowd.</p>

<p>“Here!” he said.</p>

<p>Nomad looked at him by the light of the fire. He
saw a youth of comely appearance, yet with a certain
hardness of face that showed a desperate attempt
at recklessness.</p>

<p>“You’ve been braggin’ of yer nerve,” said Snaky
Pete to the youth. “Hyer’s yer chance to show it!”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton looked at his chief uneasily.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand you!” he said, in clear-cut
tones that were quite unlike the gruff, thick speech
of his companions.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, hyer’s a chance to show yer nerve, and prove
that you’re one of us. You need hardenin’. We’ve
got this old fool; but we can’t keep him, and we can’t
let him go. Git your gun, and put a bullet through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
him, as he sets there. That’ll finish him, as a warnin’
to others like him; and then we’ll go on.”</p>

<p>The young man became as pale as if he had seen a
ghost. He looked about appealingly.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;can’t do it!” he gasped. “It’s&mdash;it’s murder!”</p>

<p>Snaky Pete glared at him.</p>

<p>“You won’t obey orders?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I’m willing to obey orders, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then, do what I tell ye!” roared the desperado
leader. “Git yer rifle, and put a bullet through this
carrion, and show you’re a man, with the nerve of a
man.”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton whitened still more, and trembled visibly.</p>

<p>The outlaws pressed close about him, staring into
his face, noting this sign of what they considered
weakness and cowardice.</p>

<p>Snaky Pete’s eyes glittered like the eyes of the
basilisk.</p>

<p>“Do ye hear me?” he yelled.</p>

<p>Clayton half turned about, as if he intended to
obey; then stopped.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t do it!” he gasped. “Don’t ask me to.”</p>

<p>Snaky Pete came closer to him, his huge first doubled.</p>

<p>“Do you obey orders?” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Crack! Snaky Pete’s heavy fist shot out, and struck
the youth full in the face, knocking him down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<p>Clayton fell, clawing at the air; and then lay still
where he had fallen.</p>

<p>The outlaw leader stepped toward him, as if he
meant to administer a kick in addition to the blow.</p>

<p>“You’re the one that’s a tarnal coward!” old Nomad
muttered. “I never seen a man o’ that kind that
wasn’t.”</p>

<p>He was apparently the only calm person there;
though it was his life that was threatened.</p>

<p>Snaky Pete lifted his heavy boot to kick Clayton,
then repented of his intention.</p>

<p>“Let him lay!” he snarled. “He’ll come ’round all
right. And we’ll move on. He ain’t got the spirit of
a skunk.”</p>

<p>The outlaws began to get their horses ready for
moving on. Snaky Pete walked up to his prisoner.
He looked fairly fiendish in the flickering firelight.</p>

<p>“Don’t git gay over this!” he growled. “You’ll go
over the range in the morning, just the same. That
young skunk will come ’round bimeby and foller on,
and then will be meek as a kitten. He’ll finish you
with that bullet, and be glad to, before we git through
with him.”</p>

<p>The sage old trapper did not answer this brutal
speech. He had learned wisdom with his years.</p>

<p>When the desperadoes lifted him to the back of old
Nebuchadnezzar the cords slipped from one of his
wrists.</p>

<p>He did not try to take advantage of it, so far as
attempting an escape was concerned; but in writhing
around, as he struggled to straighten up on his horse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
he contrived to drop from an inner pocket the letter
which Buffalo Bill found.</p>

<p>The shrewd old trapper was sure that sooner or
later the keen-eyed scout would hit that trail, and
then would find that letter, and he believed that if
he could contrive to keep the breath of life in his body
until Buffalo Bill was given time to do something, his
chances of escape were yet good. Hence, he resolved
to do nothing to unduly anger this truculent outlaw
chief and his men.</p>

<p>“I kin be as humble as a creepin’ field mouse, when
I haf to,” was his thought, “and meek and humble is
my lay now; maybe it’ll pull me through.”</p>

<p>When the outlaws went on they left Pool Clayton
lying unconscious on the grass, his horse lariated and
grazing close by him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="fs70">ABANDONED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Pool Clayton came to himself, with the darkness
about him, except where it was lightened by the
dying camp fire, he saw that he was alone&mdash;that he
had been abandoned.</p>

<p>His horse, grazing close by, tearing noisily at the
grass, was the only thing of life near him; but he shuddered
when he heard, afar off, the howl of wolves.</p>

<p>“The men have left me!” he said, staggering to his
feet.</p>

<p>There was caked blood on his face, and on his shirt,
for that blow in the face had caused his nose to bleed
freely. He was stiff and sore, and he felt dizzy and
wretchedly sick and miserable.</p>

<p>As full recollection came to him, his whole body
burned with uncontrollable rage against Snaky Pete
and the men who constituted his band of road-agent
outlaws.</p>

<p>Clayton glanced round, looked at the sky, and then
at the nearly extinct fire.</p>

<p>“They’ve been gone some time,” he said. “And
have left me out here, thinking maybe the wolves
would get me.”</p>

<p>Then he swore violently, raging against Snaky Pete,
whom he loaded with opprobrious names and noisy
abuse. By and by he became saner and cooler, though
his new hatred of Snaky Pete did not abate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>He lighted a torch of grass at the fire, and looked
for the trail of the outlaws, finding it soon.</p>

<p>“Gone on,” he said; “and they’ll camp about morning
at the Poplar Bluffs.”</p>

<p>He knew the place, and was sure he could find the
outlaws in camp there; but he did not know whether
to follow them or not.</p>

<p>In his searching he expected to come upon the body
of the old trapper, being fully persuaded that Snaky
Pete meant his death.</p>

<p>“They’ll shoot him, and leave him by the trail for
the wolves to eat,” he said. “Maybe that’s what the
wolves are howling over now.” He shuddered, as
when Snaky Pete commanded him to shoot the old
man. “I couldn’t do that!” was his thought. “I
couldn’t do it!”</p>

<p>He stirred the fire into new life, for its light drove
away a certain lonely feeling that troubled him. And
he began to think of what he should now do.</p>

<p>“I was a fool for ever joinin’ ’em,” he assured himself,
groaning over the memory of Snaky Pete’s brutal
blow. “He’ll kill me, mebbe, if I foller ’em; and the
boys will make sport of me.”</p>

<p>He was beginning to realize that he was not, after
all, cut from the same cloth as these outlaws.</p>

<p>He had been wild in the town, had gambled, and
got into bad company; and, being tempted one night,
he had gone with an acquaintance and joined Snaky
Pete’s band of road agents; being assured by his new
friend&mdash;one of Snaky Pete’s men&mdash;that the life led
by this band was one long and gay carouse, with plenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of fun&mdash;altogether a desirable life for a young man of
courage and spirit; who felt the chafing restraint of
law and order.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton had been with the band less than a
week, and was finding the life anything but what he
had pictured it. The men were rougher and coarser
and more brutal than he had imagined; and altogether
the delightful stir and excitement had not been what he
anticipated. Snaky Pete, whom he knew only too well,
had been cruelly harsh, and had told him he was a
coward and a milksop, and needed “hardening.”</p>

<p>Already there had been several attempts to “harden”
him; that is, to brutalize him, from which he had
shrunk. This last attempt, however, had gone beyond
anything he had dreamed of; when he was ordered to
kill a man in cold blood, just as if that man were no
more than a wolf. Clayton had not been able to do
it; and this was the result&mdash;struck senseless to the
ground, and abandoned on the lonely prairie.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I’d better go back to the town,” he said;
“I ain’t fit for this.”</p>

<p>But back in the town officers were watching for him
for some small offense against the law; and he abandoned
the thought of doing that when he recalled the
fact.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing he could do except follow
the outlaws and rejoin them. He believed that long
before he could overtake them the old trapper would
be murdered and put out of the way, and that murder,
at least, would not be forced on him.</p>

<p>“I s’pose I can bear the boys chaffing and joking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
me,” he mused. “And I reckon I do need hardening,
if I’m to keep with ’em, and lead this life. I reckon
I am a sort of milksop and weak.”</p>

<p>Yet he could not feel right toward Snaky Pete. A
feeling that was murderous burned in his very soul
against the brutal outlaw leader.</p>

<p>“That he should treat me that way&mdash;he!&mdash;when
he’d ought to be my best friend! I wouldn’t joined
’em, but fer the fact that I learned he was the leader;
and now to have him treat me that way!”</p>

<p>After a while, when he felt better and stronger,
he rose from the fire and got his horse. Then he
mounted, and rode away in the direction of Poplar
Bluffs, the camping place of which he knew.</p>

<p>His evil tendencies, and evil surroundings and past,
had conquered again; he meant to rejoin the road
agents, and “face the music,” whatever it might be.</p>

<span class="fs70">TAUNTS AND JEERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pool Clayton reached Poplar Bluffs, an isolated
point on the river, at the foot of a spur of the Sepulcher
Mountains, after daylight, but he did not at once
venture into the camp. He could not summon up
enough courage until he saw a number of outlaws ride
away from the camp, and guessed that one of them
was Snaky Pete.</p>

<p>When he entered the camp he found but few of the
outlaws there, and those few seemed to be under command
of a young fellow not much older than himself.
This young fellow was a weasel-eyed, rat-faced
youth, named Tom Molloy, as desperate a character
for his years as one could wish to see.</p>

<p>Moreover, Molloy had no love for Pool Clayton.
He had a feeling that Clayton thought himself the better
of the two, and it had aroused his dislike and
enmity.</p>

<p>“So you’ve come sneakin’ in, have ye?” he sneered,
his little eyes gleaming with vindictive animosity. “I
shouldn’t think you would, after that!”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton’s face flushed to a deep red, then
paled. He had expected to receive the jeers of the
outlaws, but it did not please him to have this young
fellow begin the thing. Nor did it please him to discover,
as he did at once, that Molloy was leader here,
in the absence of the chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>“Where have they gone?” he asked, ignoring Molloy’s
words.</p>

<p>“Gone to rake in another prisoner fer you to shoot!”
was the brutal answer. One of the outlaws “ha-hahed”
at this, his sympathies being against Clayton.
“And as the other one is here yit, you’ll have two to
shoot, soon’s the boss gits back.”</p>

<p>Clayton did not answer, but slid out of his saddle.</p>

<p>“The boss said that if you did come back you’d got
to do what he ordered ye to, er he’d sure shoot you!”
Molloy added, with a sneer.</p>

<p>Clayton picketed his horse, and returned to where
the outlaws were grouped. At one side lay the prisoner,
old Nick Nomad; and Nomad’s horse was with
the other horses, grazing by the stream.</p>

<p>“You heard what I said?” snapped Molloy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard what you said.”</p>

<p>Clayton felt and looked confused. His cheeks
burned hot again, and he knew he was trembling a little.
Yet he tried to hide this indication of weakness.</p>

<p>Some of the men greeted him, but coldly and rather
surlily. He saw that he had fallen in their estimation.
It was a rule of the band that whatever the
“boss” ordered had to be done, and no questions asked.
Clayton had refused to obey orders, and that made
him a marked man.</p>

<p>“If you heard what I said, why don’t you answer?”
Molloy demanded.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to,” Clayton flared, shaken by growing
anger. “Who are <em>you</em>, anyway?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>Molloy doubled a hairy red fist and stepped in front
of him.</p>

<p>“You don’t, hey? I reckon you know I’m commander
here now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Clayton eyed that hairy and threatening
fist.</p>

<p>“Then speak with respect to me. Do you understand
that? You’ve got to speak with respect to me,
or I’ll hammer your face in ag’in.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t you did it.”</p>

<p>“You think I can’t, eh?”</p>

<p>Molloy shook his hairy, red fist under Clayton’s
nose.</p>

<p>Clayton hesitated, and looked about uneasily. He
knew that since his refusal of the night he was looked
on as a coward by these men. Molloy was bullying
him because of that. Molloy was himself the coward,
and Clayton felt it&mdash;yet he hesitated, merely pushing
the red fist away when it was thrust so close that it
touched the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” he protested mildly; so mildly that
Molloy was only encouraged to continue his bullying.</p>

<p>“I’m not to, eh?” said Molloy, pushing his fist once
more against Clayton’s nose, this time with such
strength it was almost a blow.</p>

<p>“I tell you not to do that again!” said Clayton,
his tone rising.</p>

<p>“And what will you do? Hey&mdash;you coward, what
will you do? I’m in command here, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said you’re not, but I tell you not to do
that again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>Some of the men rose, grinning; this was becoming
interesting to them.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, Molloy!” one of them sang out.</p>

<p>Molloy pushed his fist against Clayton’s nose, this
time so strongly that it brought blood, for Clayton’s
nose was still sensitive and ready to bleed at a touch.
The dripping of blood down on his shirt caused Clayton
to turn white as a sheet; his eyes glittered with a
sort of flash, and he clenched his fists.</p>

<p>“You’re a bully and a coward,” he said, in a low,
tense tone. “And if you think I’m afraid of you, or
afraid to fight you, you’re mistaken.”</p>

<p>He stepped back, and began slowly to take off his
coat. His head was roaring in a queer way, and flecks
of red seemed to shoot and dart before his eyes.</p>

<p>The men gathered around, forming a ring, with
the youths in the middle.</p>

<p>“Slug him, Molloy!” said the one who had chipped
in before.</p>

<p>Molloy could hardly believe his eyes, when he saw
that Clayton was coolly preparing to fight him. He
sprang at him, but one of the men caught and held
him.</p>

<p>“Meet him fair,” he was adjured; “meet him fair!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll meet him fair!” Molloy snarled, really
amazed by the discovery that he would have to fight;
“and I’ll hammer him to a pulp.”</p>

<p>He shook himself free of the man’s hands, and began
to take off his own coat and roll up his sleeves.
His arms were big and red, covered with freckles, and
unpleasant looking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>Clayton’s arms, as he bared them, were white as a
girl’s, above the tan circles of his wrists; but, white as
they were, they looked firm and hard and muscular.
His face, too pale, did not show fear now, nor cowardice.</p>

<p>“Now I’m ready for you!” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“And here you git it!” howled Molloy, his anger
flaming red in his freckled face. “Look out, for I’m
coming!”</p>

<p>He leaped and swung, thinking to knock Clayton
down at a blow. To his surprise, Clayton side-stepped
and dodged, so that the blow, meant for his face, went
over his head.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;crack! Clayton’s hard white fist fell full on
the freckled face of the bully, and Molloy tumbled
backward, and would have fallen if one of the outlaws
had not caught him.</p>

<p>Molloy was dazed by that blow; but he saw that if
he did not now whip Clayton he would lose his standing
with these men.</p>

<p>Clayton was standing quite still, his broad chest
heaving, his eyes glittering, and his face still pale; he
had his hands up, ready for defense.</p>

<p>When Molloy came again, his blow missed, and so
did Clayton’s; and then they locked in a fierce grapple,
each striving to throw the other.</p>

<p>The men stood about, clapping their hands and
urging on the fighting. This was to them as good
as a circus.</p>

<p>“Slug him, Molloy!”</p>

<p>“Stand up to him, Pool!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p>“Hook him under the jaw!”</p>

<p>“Cave in his face!”</p>

<p>Such were the commands shouted, as the men
hopped about in their excitement.</p>

<p>The combatants came to the ground together, Clayton
underneath. Molloy had his arms around Clayton,
and now tried to push his head against the ground,
and at the same time batter him in the face.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the watching men, Pool Clayton
was as good as whipped, but with a mighty effort he
twisted round, half rising; and then, catching Molloy
about the waist and shoulders, he lifted the young
bully and threw him through the air.</p>

<p>Molloy fell on his head and shoulders, a crashing
fall, and lay still, after sliding out on the ground in
a limp heap.</p>

<p>The thing was done so quickly, and was such a surprise,
that the men stood in breathless silence, staring.
Then one of them came up to Clayton and offered
his hand, which Clayton took.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think ye’d do it, Pool,” he confessed. “But
you’re a game rooster, after all; and here’s my hand
on’t!”</p>

<p>Molloy groaned, writhed about, and then came
slowly to a sitting position, dabbing at his face weakly
with his hands, and fluttering his eyelids. For a minute
he didn’t know what had happened to him. Then
he saw the grinning faces about him, and Pool Clayton
standing, white-faced and with arms folded,
near by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>At sight of that face, evoking recollections of what
had happened, Molloy uttered a scream of rage, and
drew his revolver. He leveled it quick as a flash and
fired, uttering an oath as he did so. Instantly, however,
one of the outlaws sprang at him and succeeded
in striking his arm, thus turning the weapon aside. He
pushed Molloy back violently, and took the revolver
from his hands.</p>

<p>“None o’ that!” he cried sternly. “We don’t do
that kind o’ work, ye know! If you’re licked, you’re
licked; and you’d ought to take it like a man.”</p>

<p>Molloy turned on him, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>“Gimme my revolver!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The man tossed it to one of his friends.</p>

<p>“Not on yer life. I don’t!”</p>

<p>“I’m boss here, ain’t I? Gimme that revolver!”</p>

<p>“And let ye shoot Clayton?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your bizness! Gimme that revolver!”</p>

<p>The man stood facing him. “See here!” he said.
“We reports this biz to Snaky Pete, and Snaky Pete
ain’t goin’ to like it. And we don’t take no more
orders frum you while he’s gone. Do you git that
through yer head, or do I have to hammer it into it
with my fist? You’re no longer boss of this outfit.
Ben, there, takes yer place; and he’s got yer revolver.
Now go off some’eres and think it over.”</p>

<p>Molloy might have protested further, but that a
feeling of dizzy faintness came upon him, and he had
to drop to a seat on the ground.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton felt bewildered, rather than exultant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and he had forebodings. He did not know how this
whole thing would be regarded by Snaky Pete.</p>

<p>He walked out to his horse, after putting his coat
on, and changed the picket pin, trying to find something
to occupy himself with, while he could think.
Finally he came back and sat down by the fire.</p>

<p>Molloy, lying on the grass, panting and dizzy, glared
at him malevolently. The men said nothing, though
they steadily regarded both him and Molloy.</p>

<p>“A good un fer you!” said a voice.</p>

<p>Nick Nomad had spoken, much to Clayton’s surprise.</p>

<p>“I was bettin’ on ye frum the fust jump. Whenever
I hear a feller hollerin’ and pawin’ round, tearin’ up
the ground like a mad bull, wantin’ to fight, I allus
knows thet thar’s more wind in him than courage;
and so I knowed you’d do him up. And I’m congratulatin’
ye on it.”</p>

<p>Molloy lifted himself on his elbow and shot a malignant
glance at the old trapper.</p>

<p>“Is it your cut in?” he snapped. “Shut yer head,
and keep it shut, or I’ll feed bullets into yer mouth.”</p>

<p>“I’m thet hungry I could eat anything,” said the
old trapper, “even bullets.”</p>

<p>The answer brought a laugh from the outlaws, and
seemed to lessen the tension.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton had dropped down near the old trapper,
but he did not now look at him. But soon he
heard the trapper say, and knew that the words were
intended for him, even though they might be overheard
by the other outlaws:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p>“My old pard, Buffler Bill, has been sighted in this
section of kentry, yer friends has told me, and the boss
has gone out ter investigate reports about him; and he
says if Buffler is caught, then you’ll have the fun of
shootin’ both him and me. I’m cal’lating that there
will be things doin’ some when they catches Buffler!
He ain’t sich a fool as me.”</p>

<span class="fs70">CLOSING IN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Snaky Pete had in his band some of the finest
trailers of the West, some being men who had made
their mark as scouts in earlier and better days.</p>

<p>These men had “gone wrong” at last, and were
now outlaws; but they had not lost their skill in scouting
and trailing; and on them Snaky Pete relied for
information concerning Buffalo Bill, if the latter was
really in the country.</p>

<p>After leaving camp, Snaky Pete’s scouts and spies
broke into two bands, one being under his command,
and the other under command of a faithful lieutenant
whose cruelties had gained him the name of The White
Wolf.</p>

<p>It was now the night of the second day of their investigations,
after news had been received from the
town confirming the information of Buffalo Bill’s
presence and mission. Word had come to Snaky Pete
that Buffalo Bill had been sighted.</p>

<p>As strange as anything was the statement that the
great border scout was accompanied by a woman of
hatchety face and elderly aspect.</p>

<p>The informants brought a description of the place
where Buffalo Bill and this female had gone into
camp; and, after a discussion with his men, Snaky
Pete decided to try to surround the scout there, and
capture or kill him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p>Horses were left behind, lest by neighing or stamping
they should reveal their presence to the man whom
the outlaws hoped to take.</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the morning the late moon came
up, giving light; and Snaky Pete delayed his attack
until that hour, for the camp of the scout was in a
dark hollow, and light was needed to make an attack
on it successful. By the hour of midnight Snaky Pete
and his men were on the mountain slope just below
this camp, and they were creeping up the slope when
the first faint light in the cast heralded the rising
moon.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had been duly diligent, yet he knew
nothing of this stealthy approach of the road agents
who were determined on his destruction. He had
fallen asleep in the earlier part of the night, but now
he was awake, having been aroused at about one
o’clock. At his command Pizen Jane had lain down,
dropping into sound slumber.</p>

<p>The scout knew he was in a dangerous country. In
addition to the road agents who had captured Nomad,
Indians were known by him to be in the neighborhood.
All signs pointed to this as a particularly dangerous
locality.</p>

<p>The scout sat in the darkness, before the rising of
the moon. His feet were over the concealed fire in a
hole in the ground, to keep them warm, for the night
was cold, and his coat was drawn tightly about him.
His rifle was by his side, and in their places were his
revolvers and knife.</p>

<p>The night was very dark just before the moon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
appearance, and he observed that it also was remarkably
quiet. Though some wolves howled afar off,
near at hand not a sound was to be heard.</p>

<p>This was to his mind suggestive, and portended
danger. He thought it meant Indians.</p>

<p>Whether they were crawling on him or not, he
could not tell, but that Indians were moving about
seemed probable, even in the deathly stillness.</p>

<p>His horse, which had been grazing peacefully, became
restless. However, after a few snorts it settled
down again to nibbling at the scanty grass, though
soon it ceased to feed.</p>

<p>The scout rose now, undoubling his tall form and
standing erect in the darkness, with rifle in hand and
head bent in a listening attitude. He saw the dark
shape where the woman lay.</p>

<p>“No use to arouse her,” was his thought; “she needs
all the sleep she can get.”</p>

<p>Pizen Jane was still an enigma to him, in spite of
the vast amount of talking she had done. The information
given of herself had not been much more informing
than word puzzles, but she had clung to him,
refusing to leave him, while stoutly declaring that her
mission there was the same as his&mdash;to hunt down outlaws.</p>

<p>When he heard nothing, the scout walked out to his
horse. He found it with head up and ears pricked forward,
as if it either saw or heard something suspicious.</p>

<p>Standing by his horse, with hand on the lariat
close to its nose, the scout looked out into the silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
darkness, while his imagination pictured there crawling
Indian forms. He did not think of outlaws.</p>

<p>The moon rose, lighting the rim of the hollow
where he had pitched camp; but the rim was covered
with a thick growth of bushes and small trees, and
so concealed from his searching eyes the forms of the
desperadoes who had crept up there.</p>

<p>Suddenly they jumped into view, in the red moonlight,
yelling as wildly as if they were Indians; and,
with revolvers cracking, they sprang down into the
hollow, where they expected to find the scout asleep.</p>

<p>With one swift circling motion Buffalo Bill drew
his knife and cut the rope that picketed his horse. In
another instant he was on its back, and then, with a
wild dash, he broke through the thin line of outlaws
on that side.</p>

<p>He knew that if he returned to assist Pizen Jane
his life would pay for it; and he preferred that she
should fall into the hands of these men, leaving him
alive, so that he might aid her later; a thing he certainly
could not do if he rushed down there and fell
under the fire of their revolvers. Yet he had a certain
twinge of conscience, which seemed to accuse
him of cowardice and an abandonment of Pizen Jane.</p>

<p>“But she can take care of herself, if any person
in the world can, and later I can do something for
her,” he thought, as he drove his horse pell-mell
through the cracking bushes and the whipping branches
of the low trees.</p>

<p>The outlaws near him yelled, and took snapshots at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
him; and soon other shots came ripping through the
brush after him.</p>

<p>But he had cleared the cordon which Snaky Pete
was certain he had drawn around the camp; and, with
a good horse under him, he felt secure, even though
that horse had now neither saddle nor bridle.</p>

<p>He waved his hand grimly in the direction of the
yelling outlaws, as his horse galloped on into the open,
and he saw the gray prairies at the foot of the mountains
lying before him in the light of the rising moon.</p>

<p>“Catch me, if you can!” he shouted, almost gay in
the thought of the manner in which the outlaws had
let him slip through the meshes of their net.</p>

<p>Then he recalled that now both the woman and old
Nick Nomad were prisoners in their hands, while he
had escaped by the narrowest margin; and, realizing
the delicate and dangerous work lying now before him,
he mentally girded himself anew for the desperate
work thus laid on him.</p>

<span class="fs70">A DEFIANT PRISONER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pizen Jane was aroused from heavy slumber by
the yells of the road agents and the crackling fire of
their revolvers. She sprang up in bewilderment and
momentary terror.</p>

<p>Men almost ran over her, as they dashed in pursuit
of the scout. One came up to her, and, catching her
roughly by the arm, jerked her round.</p>

<p>Her anger blazed at the insult. Drawing back her
fist, she struck him in the face.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me, I reckon?” she cried. “Well,
I’m Pizen Jane, of Cinnabar, and I don’t ’low no
mis’rable specimen of a man to treat me as if I wasn’t
a lady.”</p>

<p>The astounded road agent put a hand to his tingling
face. Then, as she seemed about to give him a second
blow, he ducked and stepped backward.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said, not without humor; “but I
didn’t know I’d run up ag’inst the hind leg of a
mule!”</p>

<p>Other desperadoes came rushing up, and they surrounded
her, asking questions.</p>

<p>“It’s none o’ yer bizness who I am, er what I’m
doin’ here!” she snapped. “But I’m Pizen Jane, of
Cinnabar; and what my bizness is you’ll know ’fore
you’re ready fer it, lemme tell ye! And if any o’ you
cattle thinks he can make fun o’ me, er tries to git<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
gay with me, he’ll mighty quick wish’t he’d gone to
some school of good manners.”</p>

<p>“You was with Buffalo Bill?”</p>

<p>“What if I was; an’ what if I wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“That was him that rid off on that hoss?”</p>

<p>“Foller him and ask him, and then mebbe you’ll
find out!”</p>

<p>She folded her arms and looked about defiantly, not
at all afraid of them, apparently; and she made a
queer figure, as she stood there, thus surrounded, with
the light of the rising moon revealing her gaunt form
and homely features.</p>

<p>The chase of the scout, to judge from the sounds,
was of a lively character; there was a continual popping
of rifles and revolvers, as the outlaws took snapshots
at him, or at shadows which they mistook for
him.</p>

<p>“I reckon they ain’t goin’ to git him,” said Pizen
Jane complacently, as she cocked an ear in the direction
of the uproar.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got you!” was the grim answer.</p>

<p>“And a lot o’ good it will do ye! Now that you’ve
got me, what ye goin’ to do with me? I ain’t got
no money, and I’m too old and homely fer any o’ ye
to want me fer a wife.”</p>

<p>She had recovered her mental balance, if it had indeed
been lost at all. Now she sat down on the
ground very deliberately, and smoothed her tangled
hair and her travel-stained dress.</p>

<p>Some of the pursuing road agents began to come
in, breathless and spent. They stared hard at her;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and she snapped at them with vinegary answers when
they asked questions.</p>

<p>One of the men who soon returned from the pursuit
was Snaky Pete.</p>

<p>When her eyes lighted on him they burned with a
fiercer fire than had been in them lately. She got up
and strode toward him, her fingers outstretched as if
she meant to tear his face.</p>

<p>“So, it’s you, is it?” she cried. “Well, I might ’a’
knowed it was you, and I did partly guess it! You
low-lived, knock-kneed, white-livered, flea-bitten, devil-hunted&mdash;&mdash;”
She stopped, gasping, unable to find
words to express her detestation and hatred; but went
on again: “Oh, you mis’rable scum of the earth! You
pestiferous, walkin’ image of a man! I’ve found you,
and now I settle with you!”</p>

<p>She stopped, and slowly drew a revolver from the
folds of her dress. In another moment she would
have shot Snaky Pete dead, if one of his men had not
knocked the weapon from her hand.</p>

<p>She struggled with this man, shrieking, and tearing
at him, frantically trying to regain her revolver.</p>

<p>When she was held, for others were forced to go
to their comrade’s aid, she stood panting and glaring
at Snaky Pete, who had not said a word, but stared
at her with wide eyes that hardly blinked.</p>

<p>“Jane Clayton!” he gasped. “I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You thought I’d be too much of a woman, and
too big a coward to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thought you was dead,” he said; “I was told it,
and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>“Hoped I was, eh? Well, I ain’t! I’m alive enough
to make things warm fer ye, and I’m here to do it.
Leggo of me!”</p>

<p>This last was directed to the men who clung to her.</p>

<p>“Leggo of me!” she screeched at them, flinging
herself to and fro.</p>

<p>“Search her and see if she’s got other weapons,”
said Snaky Pete.</p>

<p>The men had been astounded on hearing her words
to him; the whole thing was to them strange and mysterious.
They searched her, but not very thoroughly.</p>

<p>“Now, what aire you doin’ here?” Snaky Pete demanded
of her. “You was with that man!”</p>

<p>“Yes, with a man callin’ hisself Buffler Bill, though
I don’t know if he tole the truth about it. What of it?
He was huntin’ outlaws, he said; and so was I. And
we j’ined teams, each to help the other. I jedge, by
the way you tried to git him, that he’s the ginuine
Buffler. And may the Lord speed him in runnin’
away from ye!”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you know that you’ve run yerself into a
good deal of danger by yer foolishness?” said Snaky
Pete. “If we’ll let you go in the mornin’, and give
ye a horse, will you cut out fer the town?”</p>

<p>“Will I? Not till I git through with you!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll send you under escort; and if you
won’t go no other way, we’ll tie you to a horse and
make you go.”</p>

<p>“Pete Sanborn,” she said, scorn in her voice, “of
all the mean, low-down cowards on this earth, you’re
the wust! You’re afeard o’ me, and you’d better be.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Oh, I kin tell these gapin’, white-livered wretches with
ye that I know you. And why shouldn’t I, sense I
was yer wife fer more’n two years, and had a chance
to know how beastly mean a man kin be when he gits
down and tries? I come huntin’ ye, fer one thing;
and I’ve found ye.”</p>

<p>Snaky Pete seemed afraid of her.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” he said; but she cackled defiantly.</p>

<p>“I won’t! I’m goin’ to tell these men what a
coward ye aire. You remember that time you knocked
the drunk man down in the street, and then drug him
into an alley and robbed him? And do ye recklect that
other time, when you stole the gold altar service from
a church, and melted it down and sold it? And do
you recall that other time, when&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Close your head!” he shouted. He sprang at her,
wild-eyed and fiendish; but she clawed him in the
face, and he fell back.</p>

<p>“Take her away!” he commanded. “Kill her&mdash;do
anything! Take her away!”</p>

<p>The men dragged her away, while she screamed and
raved her hatred of the man who had once been her
husband.</p>

<p>Snaky Pete tried to turn the incident aside as a jest.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” he said, “that woman’s got a tongue
worse than a whip! She’ll kill me. I did marry her,
but that tongue made me mighty sick of my bargain,
and I left her. She’s sore over that, and she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped as if disturbed by the angry outcries of
Pizen Jane, but it was really because he realized that
he might talk too much himself.</p>

</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill was not captured by Snaky Pete’s road
agents.</p>

<p>The escape of the dreaded scout annoyed them.
They feared him, and knowledge that he was in that
region disconcerted and troubled them greatly.</p>

<p>They returned to the pursuit after daylight, but had
no better success, and at length gave over the attempt
to capture the elusive scout.</p>

<p>When Snaky Pete and his band, with their woman
prisoner, reached the camp at Poplar Bluffs, Tom
Molloy and Pool Clayton, with their strife and bickering,
had disrupted the band left there, and were on
the point of settling the trouble by a free-for-all fight.</p>

<p>“You’ll be int’rested in some one there,” Snaky
Pete had said to Pizen Jane.</p>

<p>That she was interested was proved by the outcry
she made as her eyes fell on Pool Clayton.</p>

<p>“So you’re here, Bruce, jes’ as I expected to find
ye?” she sputtered. “Right here with these pizen
skunks, after you writ to me that you had fell into
the hands of a fake Buffler Bill, who was a road agent,
and that he was holdin’ you a pris’ner, and was likely
to murder ye! What did you mean by writin’ that
pack o’ lies to yer own mother?”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton’s face grew as red as a beet. He
looked at Snaky Pete and the road agents, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
back at the woman who had so suddenly announced
that he was her son.</p>

<p>On the ground lay the prisoner, Nick Nomad, who
had a twinkle in his eyes now.</p>

<p>“What did ye mean?” she screamed at Pool Clayton.
“Here I find this pizen scamp that used to call
hisself my husband, and with him I find you! Both
o’ ye road agents&mdash;the man that was my husband and
the boy that was my son!”</p>

<p>Pizen Jane’s voice broke in a sort of pitiful wail,
and Nomad saw the tears come into her eyes.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton looked confused and sheepish; Snaky
Pete looked angry and humiliated.</p>

<p>“Here, shut up yer yawp!” Snaky Pete shouted
to her. “You’re a nuisance; do ye know it?”</p>

<p>“A nuisance is a good sight more of a credit to
ther community than a murderous wretch like you!”
she retorted. “Shut up yer own yawp! The Lord
gimme my tongue, and I’ve a right to use it, and I’m
goin’ to.”</p>

<p>She turned again to Pool Clayton.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of ye!” she said. “Why did you
write me sich a pack o’ lies?”</p>

<p>“Just to make you think I&mdash;I was killed, or would
be,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“You didn’t want me to know that you had turned
road agent. You didn’t want me to know that you’d
j’ined forces with that measly runt there that I heard
one of these men call Snaky Pete. Well, he <em>is</em> snaky,
and he’s worse’n snaky.”</p>

<p>Then her voice and manner changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>“Pool,” she said, with something of motherly tenderness
in her voice, “it hurt me to believe that you’d
gone wrong; and to find you here hurts me more than
that did. Git out of it, son; leave this crowd of villains,
and try to be an honest man. I’m a pore old
woman, but I’ll work my finger nails off to git ye a
start in some honest way, if you’ll jes’ make a try
to be honest.”</p>

<p>“Take her away,” commanded Snaky Pete, irritated
and wrathful.</p>

<p>She suffered herself to be led away, broken in spirit
now, and sobbing. For the moment, at least, she was
no longer Pizen Jane, but a heartbroken old woman.</p>

<p>The stir caused by the return of the main body of
desperadoes caused the feud between Pool Clayton
and Tom Molloy to be forgotten, or overlooked, for
a time.</p>

<p>The astonishing claim of Pizen Jane, that Pool Clayton
was her son and that Snaky Pete was her recreant
husband, was enough of itself to make the outlaws
forget that Clayton and Molloy had fought, and were
threatening bloody things against each other.</p>

<p>Snaky Pete walked nervously about, giving orders
in a tone of irritation which masked somewhat the
real feelings of his heart. He observed the prisoner,
old Nick Nomad, then he looked at Pool Clayton, who
had withdrawn to a distance, both from his mother
and from Snaky Pete, his stepfather.</p>

<p>Molloy had slunk away, and was busily engaged in
making himself inconspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>Snaky Pete grew wrathful and murderously vindictive.</p>

<p>“Here!” he snarled, speaking to Pool Clayton.
“You ain’t done yit what I told ye to!” He swung
his hand toward Nick Nomad, as he thus spoke to the
young would-be outlaw. “I told you to shoot that old
skunk, and git him out of the way, and you ain’t
done it!”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton came forward when Snaky Pete
shouted to him a second time.</p>

<p>“You needn’t think that you and yer mother kin
come here and run this camp! If she makes trouble,
I’ll lay a stingin’ quirt across her back, and you’ve got
to mind me, er I’ll put a bullet through your head
instanter, and git rid of ye!”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton stood before him, trembling.</p>

<p>“Do ye hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Clayton.</p>

<p>“Then finish up the job that you wouldn’t do when I
first tole ye to; put a bullet through that ole fool instanter.
He’s a pard of Buffalo Bill, and out he goes.
We can’t keep him, and we can’t afford to let him go.”</p>

<p>Old Nick Nomad never changed countenance as he
heard these brutal orders.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” he had said once, talking with his old
border pard, “I allus tries ter live, so that when ther
eend comes I can face it square and honest. My hand
has been ag’inst wrong, and I has tried to keep it frum
doin’ wrong.”</p>

<p>In that confident assurance old Nick Nomad lived,
and in it he could now die, if he had to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>Yet the warm currents of life ran through his veins
still, almost as freely as when he was a youth, and
he did not desire death. He desired to live, that he
might further strike at the wrongdoers of the border;
and even as he listened to Snaky Pete he was wondering
how he could escape the doom which those words
seemingly foreshadowed.</p>

<p>Another heard Snaky Pete’s brutal and murderous
commands. The other was Pizen Jane. She stepped
courageously in front of the old trapper, brushing
away the hands of the outlaws who would have restrained
her.</p>

<p>“Aire you a friend of Buffler Bill&mdash;the ginuine Buffler
Bill?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Lady,” said Nomad, “I is happy ter say thet I’m
one of thet man’s closest friends. I’ll never deny thet,
even afore ther Judgment.”</p>

<p>She faced around toward Snaky Pete.</p>

<p>“Pete Sanborn,” she said, her words sharp as
knives, “when you kill this man you shoot me down,
too; and as fur as lettin’ any son of mine do a thing
like that, I’ll slay him with my own hands fust!”</p>

<p>Snaky Pete’s eyes glittered and his face almost grew
black with rage.</p>

<p>“Git out of my way!” he yelled, drawing a long
knife. He lifted it, and jumped with it at the fearless
woman.</p>

<p>A rifle cracked, seeming far off on the slope of the
near-by mountain. Snaky Pete stopped in mid-air,
and, throwing up his hands, he fell to the earth, blood
spurting from between his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>The men of the camp stood still, shocked and confused;
then a yell of wrath broke forth. Some of
them threw themselves on their horses, while others
rushed to Snaky Pete, lifting him.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” screamed Pizen Jane, waving her gaunt
arms. “If the devil is dead, I know who killed him!
’Twas Buffler Bill!”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE DESERT HOTSPUR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill had not only evaded and baffled the outlaws,
but had circled around them, struck their trail,
and had followed it so closely that, from the mountain
side, he had been able to look down into the camp
and behold the scenes which have been described.</p>

<p>He had strong field glasses, that drew the actors
close to him, apparently. He saw them so clearly that
he almost fancied he could follow the conversation.
His long-range rifle lay at his side. He saw that Nomad
was there as a prisoner, and certain actions told
him that Nomad was in peril. He also fancied that
Pizen Jane’s life was being threatened.</p>

<p>As he looked, lowering his field glasses occasionally,
he fitted to his rifle telescopic sights, taking them from
a pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>On all the border there was not another rifle shot
like Buffalo Bill. He was famous as a long-range
sharpshooter.</p>

<p>Instead of looking longer through the field glasses,
he looked now through the telescopic sights of his
rifle. He saw Snaky Pete standing before the woman,
who was protecting Nick Nomad with her body. He
saw the knife raised and glittering in Snaky Pete’s
hand. Then his rifle cracked, with the sights bearing
on the outlaw leader; and the bullet speeding true, he
saw Snaky Pete pitch up his hands and roll to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Good work!” he said, patting the rifle affectionately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
“That was about as long a shot as I ever made;
but I got him.”</p>

<p>He saw men spring for their horses, and knew they
would ride out to the point where the rifle had
sounded; yet he lingered long enough to see Snaky
Pete lifted and carried aside.</p>

<p>“I didn’t kill him,” he said. “The distance was too
great, and I didn’t strike a vital spot; but he’ll remember
it for some time, I’ve no doubt, and maybe
it will teach him better manners.”</p>

<p>He removed the telescopic sight and stowed it away
and placed the field glasses in their case.</p>

<p>Taking up his rifle, he made his way down the hill,
keeping out of view of the horsemen who were now
riding hard in his direction.</p>

<p>Some distance below, in a growth of aspens, his
horse had been concealed. Mounting, he rode down
the slope. Then, swinging round the projecting base
of the hill, he shaped his course across the open country.
His horse was speedy, and it was seemingly untiring.</p>

<p>Though the outlaws saw him soon, and gave hot
chase, he steadily drew away from them, and in an
hour he had lost sight even of the foremost.</p>

<p>That night, as darkness fell, the great scout was
before the gate at Fort Thompson, where a company
of cavalry was stationed. He was challenged; then he
was admitted and conducted to the headquarters of
Major Clendenning, the commander.</p>

<p>Cody’s horse was in a white lather of sweat from
its long run; and the scout’s clothing was powdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
with white dust, and dust streaked his face to a grayish
tinge. He showed every indication of long and
hard riding.</p>

<p>Clendenning sprang up, with outstretched hand,
when the noted scout was brought before him.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had saluted, but he now took the extended
hand of the officer.</p>

<p>“In the name of Heaven, Cody, where have you
come from?” cried the major. “I thought you were
over about the Sepulcher Mountains.”</p>

<p>“So I was, major,” was his answer, “but now I am
here. I rode from there since this morning.”</p>

<p>Major Clendenning’s amazement showed in his face.</p>

<p>“You had a change of horses, no doubt, and you
must be nearly dead! Let me get you some wine!”</p>

<p>“I had only one horse. He is pretty well exhausted,
but will be all right after a rest. I need another, which
I hope you can let me have.”</p>

<p>“Swallow the wine, Cody, and then I’ll hear your
story. Straight from the Sepulcher Mountains since
morning!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill drank the wine, and then began to tell
his story.</p>

<p>“Nomad is a prisoner,” was one of his statements,
“and so is a woman from Cinnabar who calls herself
Pizen Jane. I’m not just certain of her, but she
bravely stood up before Nomad when that outlaw
threatened him.”</p>

<p>“She and Nomad will both be slain, if they have not
been already,” said Clendenning.</p>

<p>“It may be. I’m hoping otherwise. But I saw I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
could do no more then than I had done, and that if I
expected to aid them I must have assistance. So I
rode here to get it.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it, Cody.”</p>

<p>“I want twenty good men, well armed and provisioned.
We’ll not be able to get back there as quickly
as I came from there; but we can go as fast as possible.
I shall rescue Nomad and root out that devil’s
nest. If he has been killed, there will be some desperadoes
of the Sepulcher Mountains who will pay for
it with their lives.”</p>

<p>“You can start as early in the morning, Cody, as
you like, and you shall have the men,” said Clendenning;
“I’ll give the orders right now.”</p>

<p>He turned to the door.</p>

<p>“Stop, major; I want those men right now, without
a moment’s delay.”</p>

<p>Clendenning turned back in surprise.</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to rest, Cody; you can’t go back
without proper rest.”</p>

<p>“I’m fit to start back this minute, Major Clendenning.
It will be a favor if you detail the men who are
to go with me, and have them get ready instantly. I
should like to have you order an extra horse for me,
and while preparations are being made I’ll eat a bite,
and then go right back.”</p>

<p>Clendenning, amazed at the scout’s orders, proceeded,
however, to carry them out.</p>

<p>Twenty picked men were soon saddling horses, looking
to their rifles, packing rations, and getting ready
for a hard and swift ride to the Sepulcher Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>Buffalo Bill swallowed some food hastily, ordered
his saddle pouches to be filled with more; and then
dropped down on a lounge in the major’s headquarters
for a few winks of sleep. He had hardly stretched
himself on the lounge before he was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>He slept less than half an hour, during which time
the preparations for his departure were being hurried;
then he awoke, seemingly much refreshed and ready
for any task.</p>

<p>It was this astonishing ability to fall asleep anywhere
and at any time, and to awake after a brief
slumber apparently as refreshed as if he had slept
through a whole night, that in part made Buffalo Bill
the wonder he was on a border trail.</p>

<p>He now brushed his clothing, ate more food, and
then issued from the major’s headquarters.</p>

<p>“Men,” he said, speaking to the troopers who greeted
him, and who were about ready to follow him, “we’ll
have a hard night’s work of it, and a part of to-morrow
may be consumed if the outlaws have changed
their location; but I know you, each of you&mdash;men of
the gallant old Seventh Cavalry!&mdash;and I thank you
in advance for the success I know you will achieve.
If Nick Nomad has been killed by Snaky Pete’s desperadoes,
then desperado blood will flow before we
see this fort again.”</p>

<p>They cheered him to the echo. Not a man there
but felt proud to follow this gallant scout, whose reputation
was so closely linked with that of the famous
Seventh Cavalry.</p>

<p>Members of that noted regiment had died with Custer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
on the battlefield of the Little Bighorn, when a
handful of men were overwhelmed and swept out of
existence by a horde of Indian braves, the flower of
the Sioux nation. On almost every battlefield of the
West in which Uncle Sam’s troopers were hurled
against Indians or outlaws, the gallant Seventh had
had representatives.</p>

<p>The troopers cheered again, saluting the flag, as they
passed in the night out through the heavy double gates
of the fort.</p>

<p>Major Clendenning accompanied them beyond the
limits of the fort and its grounds.</p>

<p>“Men,” he said, as he was about to turn back, “I
have a new name for our famous scout. Hotspur
usually refers to a man impetuous of temper; but it
might mean, also, I think, a man who as a horseman
rode with a spur so hot that in nine hours he covered
the distance between the Sepulcher Mountains and
Fort Thompson. So I give you a new name for him&mdash;Buffalo
Bill, the Desert Hotspur.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat to the scout; and again the troopers
cheered, their loud cheering rolling across the level
lands in a way that, if it could have been heard by
them, would have startled the desperadoes under
Snaky Pete.</p>

<p>Then the troopers, with Buffalo Bill riding swiftly
at their head, to set the pace for them, galloped away
through the night and the darkness, the thundering
of the hoofs of the horses reaching into the barracks
at the fort.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="fs70">IN THE OUTLAW STRONGHOLD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Snaky Pete’s men, when they returned, reported that
no horse they had could keep in sight of the thoroughbred
ridden by Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>The outlaw chief received the report, lying on a roll
of blankets, gasping and sputtering. The bullet fired
by the scout had struck him on the lower lip, laying
it open, knocking out some teeth, and bringing a spurt
of blood from the wound. Snaky Pete had thought he
was killed when he fell and knew that blood was pouring
from his mouth. As a matter of fact, he was not
seriously wounded, though the pain was sharp for a
time, and the character of the wound made it difficult
for him to speak.</p>

<p>His fright did not soon pass, however. Even after
his men returned with their report that Buffalo Bill had
escaped he still lay on the blankets, moaning and
cursing.</p>

<p>The fact that Buffalo Bill had ridden toward distant
Fort Thompson filled him with uneasiness. Because
of it he ordered the horses to be got ready, and
the entire band to move at once into the Sepulcher
Mountains.</p>

<p>He was filled with a sullen and savage rage against
Pizen Jane and Pool Clayton, and against Nick Nomad.
He began to believe that Pizen Jane had guided
Nomad and Buffalo Bill; and he now even suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
that Pool Clayton, in joining the band, was moved by a
desire to betray it into the hands of officers.</p>

<p>He refused to furnish Pizen Jane with a horse, declaring
that if she accompanied him she would have to
walk.</p>

<p>She came up to him, as he swayed weakly on the
horse to which he had been helped.</p>

<p>“Git out o’ my way,” he mumbled. “If you hang
’round me I’ll kill ye!”</p>

<p>“But I want to know if you ain’t goin’ to send Pool
away? I ain’t goin’ away myself, but I want Pool
turned loose on a horse, with orders fer him to go
back to Cinnabar. I’ve been talkin’ with him, and
he’ll do it. Aire ye goin’ to let him?”</p>

<p>“I’ll furnish you with a horse to clear out on,” he
said, speaking with pain and difficulty.</p>

<p>“Me? La, I ain’t goin’! But I want him to start
now, instanter. Here he’s like a good apple in the
middle of a lot of rotten ones. So I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go yourself!” Snaky Pete snarled at her.</p>

<p>“No, I stay with you!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, jest to please myself.”</p>

<p>“To help that old trapper?”</p>

<p>“No; jes’ to please myself. I’m yer wife, ain’t I?
Er I was, before I divorced ye. I think I’ll stay with
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll kill you if you do!” he fumed. “He can’t go!
Go yerself, and I’ll be glad to have you git out.”</p>

<p>She dropped back, to where Pool Clayton was riding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p>He slipped from his horse.</p>

<p>“Take it, and I’ll walk,” he said, with a guilty flush.</p>

<p>“I want you to leave these men instanter,” she urged.</p>

<p>“No; I ain’t goin’ to. Why don’t <em>you</em> go?”</p>

<p>“Me?” She leaned toward him. “Because I’ve
swore by everything that’s good and bad that I’m goin’
to kill Pete Sanborn soon’s I git the chance. He ruined
my life, and now he’s ruinin’ yourn.”</p>

<p>Her voice was low, but her face flushed as if she had
swallowed fiery liquor.</p>

<p>Snaky Pete saw her talking with the youth, and
then saw her mount the horse which Pool surrendered
to her.</p>

<p>“They’re ag’inst me!” he grumbled, under his breath.
“They’ve planned to break up the band and git me
captured. It’s revenge she’s after. Well, I’ll settle
her; and I’ll settle him, and that old trapper, too! I
see now why Pool wouldn’t shoot the old cuss; it was
’cause he’s in with him. He and she aire in with Buffalo
Bill and the officers. Likely they’re to git a reward,
if they land me. Well, I’ll settle ’em!”</p>

<p>He brooded over this, his anger mounting and his
desire to “settle ’em” growing.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I can git out of her what the plans of Buffalo
Bill aire; er mebbe I can git it out of Pool. I
reckon that Cody will try to bring soldiers from Fort
Thompson. There’s a nasty fight comin’, I can see.
Well, I’m livin’ yit; and long’s I can straddle a horse
and give orders, I’m worth a dozen men in a fight.
And if Cody thinks we won’t fight he’ll know better
when he tackles us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>His thoughts took another turn:</p>

<p>“P’r’aps I might buy Cody to draw off the soldiers
by sending him word that if he didn’t I’d kill Nomad.
It might work, and might be advisable if we git in a
tight hole.”</p>

<p>He was in a fretting and fuming mood when the
Sepulcher Mountains were entered. His wound made
him feverish, and that did not add to his good temper.
He snapped and snarled at his men whenever they
came to him for orders, and conducted himself altogether
in a disagreeable way.</p>

<p>“He’s jes’ like a bear with a sore head,” said Pizen
Jane, when she observed these things.</p>

<p>She had kept with the outlaw command, and Pool
Clayton had done the same; both of them avoiding,
as much as possible, personal contact with the irascible
leader.</p>

<p>As soon as their permanent camp was gained, in the
Sepulcher Mountains, the outlaws began to put it in
order for a fight or a siege.</p>

<p>The place was a cuplike hollow, with a pass running
through it. If an enemy could gain and hold
both ends of that pass the outlaws could only escape
by scaling the mountains. But, on the other hand,
if the outlaws barricaded those entrances into the valley
and stationed a force of riflemen behind the barricades,
the troopers who climbed over them would
have the fight of their lives to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Tn spite of the pain of his wound and his feverishness,
Snaky Pete personally superintended the strengthening
of the barricades. He saw that ammunition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
was properly distributed, and that all arms were put in
the best possible condition.</p>

<p>Night was approaching before all the defenses were
in condition to suit him. He looked them over carefully,
as he walked from point to point, his face
swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>“If they climb over them,” he thought grimly,
“there’ll be more dead troopers than live ones. When
Snaky Pete gits his back to the wall, he fights, and
they’ll find it out.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">PEERLESS AS A SCOUT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill and the troopers from Fort Thompson
struck the foothills of the Sepulcher Mountains at daybreak,
and were thus able to get under cover of the
scrub that fringed them, and out of sight of any spies
and scouts that Snaky Pete might have sent out.</p>

<p>It had been a hard night’s ride to accomplish this,
but it was worth the exertion.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was sure that the road agents had
changed their position since he saw them last. Hence,
the first thing to do was to locate them in their new
position.</p>

<p>In spite of the tremendous strain he had been under
for so long, he undertook to do this himself; and he
left the troopers in camp in a grassy nest within the
foothills, but close up to the base of the Sepulcher
range.</p>

<p>He rode his weary horse for a few miles, until he
struck the trail made by the outlaws in their retreat.
Then he left the horse well concealed, and began on
foot to follow the trail. It was so fresh looking he
thought the outlaws were not far ahead. However, he
went so slowly in order to guard against surprise, that
the afternoon was well advanced before he came in
sight of the cuplike hollow where they were preparing
to make their stand.</p>

<p>From an elevation that commanded the hollow he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
looked with his field glasses right down into the camp,
and saw the busy preparations making to meet the
troopers.</p>

<p>He was much worried, because he could not see old
Nick Nomad. He hoped, however, that the old man
was being held in one of the houses.</p>

<p>Once he beheld Pizen Jane, but only for a brief
moment or two. She came out of a low hut, and
looked about, and then went in again.</p>

<p>“I must know, if possible, if Nomad is there; and I
wish I could do something to protect that woman when
we make our charge.”</p>

<p>His study of the outlaw stronghold convinced him
that it would be folly to attack it from either end of
the pass. The barricades were strong, he saw, and
he did not wish to sacrifice the lives of any of the
troopers needlessly. So he began to examine the slopes
of the hills that led down into that hollow.</p>

<p>They were unscalable to horses, but he believed at
one point men might descend them, even in the darkness.
He made careful note of that point, and stowed
its landmarks in his memory.</p>

<p>When the shadows of coming night filled the hollow,
the scout moved from his position, and began to work
his way down toward it, screening himself behind
rocks and bushes.</p>

<p>Darkness came fully while he was still on the slope
of the hill, and he remained there until he felt it was
safe to work still nearer in to the outlaw camp.</p>

<p>Guards had been set at the barricades, and beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
them in the passes, and guards were also stationed
around the camp at intervals.</p>

<p>The scout approached so near to one of these guards
that he heard the tread of the fellow’s feet and caught
the odor of the tobacco burning in his pipe.</p>

<p>Though he desired to get still nearer in, Buffalo Bill
saw the difficulty of the attempt, for this sentry walked
a beat which crossed the line of his advance.</p>

<p>After working with much care to one side, he
crouched in the darkness and emitted there the well-known
“cuckoo” call of the prairie-dog owl, hoping by
it to reach old Nomad, if the trapper still lived.</p>

<p>The guard was not disturbed at first by the call of
the little owl, for it was a familiar sound; but when it
was several times repeated, and with a variation he
had never heard in the note, his attention was attracted.</p>

<p>“A cussed funny dog owl,” the scout heard him
mutter; and then heard him come toward him.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill desired to keep from the outlaws the
fact that their camp was being spied on, hence he
crouched low in the hollow and waited until the guard
had turned back. Then he sent forth again the
“cuckoo” call, with that queer variation which had attracted
the notice of the sentinel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the immediate success of the
scout’s efforts, Nomad was at the time asleep in one
of the huts, and so did not hear him.</p>

<p>When no answer came to his calls, the scout’s uneasiness
concerning the fate of Nomad grew.</p>

<p>Resolved to know, if possible, if the old trapper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
lived, he slipped from his place of concealment when
the sentry had walked to the farther end of his beat,
and then went sliding farther down over the steep
rocks.</p>

<p>The sentry was a keen-eared fellow, and heard the
displacement of a small stone, which rattled down the
slope. Instantly the scout flattened himself on the
rocks and waited until the stone fell.</p>

<p>After a moment of silence, the sentry again came
toward him; and soon the scout could see him faintly
in the dim light of the stars.</p>

<p>“Prairie-dog owls don’t ginerally go to rollin’
stones,” the sentinel was muttering, as he stood staring
up the slope, trying to make out what it was had started
the stone to rolling.</p>

<p>He could see nothing that warranted suspicion.</p>

<p>“Mebbe a coyote tryin’ to git at the owl,” he said
to himself; “ain’t heerd the owl fer a minute er so.
P’r’aps it was scared off by a coyote.”</p>

<p>As he came still farther up the slope, prying and
peering, he saw something, and, pitching up his rifle,
he fired at it. What he beheld was the recumbent
form of the scout flattened against the rock.</p>

<p>The scout saw the rifle pointed toward him, and
avoided its bullet by a quick, sliding movement. The
lead struck the rock over his head.</p>

<p>That sliding motion was heard and seen by the
sentry. He did not believe, then, that what he had
shot at was a man, but thought it a coyote; and, because
it had not bounded away, he thought he had slain
it. He leaped forward, swinging his rifle; while a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
roar of excited calls and questions were hurled up at
him from the camp.</p>

<p>He beheld the dark ball into which the scout had
doubled himself when he knew he could not easily
escape, and plunged toward it, with knife in hand.</p>

<p>To his astonishment, as he bent down he was caught
by the collar of his coat and jerked flat on his face.
He yelled in fright; then wheezed, as the iron fingers
of the scout settled around his windpipe.</p>

<p>The men below were yelling up at him.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s choking fingers reduced him to unconsciousness,
and then flung him aside. The scout still
lay where he had been lying; but now his revolvers
were out.</p>

<p>“That aroused the whole camp,” he said to himself,
“and I’ll have to get out of here quick.”</p>

<p>It occurred to him that in arousing the outlaws he
had probably aroused the old trapper, also, if he lived;
so he sent forth again, with that varying quaver, the
call of the little dog owl.</p>

<p>Old Nomad, who had been awakened by the rifle
shot and the clamor, heard it, and recognized it at
once. He sat bolt upright, listening for its repetition.</p>

<p>It came again, clear and unmistakable.</p>

<p>“Buffler!” he said, with a thrill of recognition. Then
he rolled to the door of the hut, for he was bound;
and from the open doorway sounded a cry similar to
that which had come from the hillside.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill heard it, a great load of dread
rolled from his heart.</p>

<p>“Nomad!” he said. “Thank Heaven he is alive!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p>Pizen Jane had been standing close by the door,
on the outside, when Nick Nomad uttered that cry of
the dog owl.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” she said, looking at him, seeing him
faintly outlined. “Have you got a dog owl hid about
ye?”</p>

<p>“A hull cageful,” he answered. And again he sent
out the cry.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was already climbing up the slope,
knowing that the outlaws would soon be there. He
was glad he had aroused old Nomad, but he regretted
that he had drawn the rifle fire of the sentry; for he
had hoped the outlaws would not guess that an enemy
had gained access to that slope of the hill overhanging
their permanent camp.</p>

<p>But regrets were useless. The only thing to be done
was to accommodate himself to the fact.</p>

<p>When the outlaws, climbing up the hill, gained the
point where the sentry lay senseless, they found him,
and flashed lights to discover if he were dead or what
had happened to him. By shaking the man, they
aroused him; and he sat up, staring and wheezing,
clutching at his aching throat.</p>

<p>“I thought it was a coyote,” he gurgled.</p>

<p>“And what was it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I dunno; but somethin’ grabbed me and
choked me, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Must have been a man!”</p>

<p>“I thought it&mdash;it was a coyote, prowlin’ round after
a dog owl,” he explained. “I heard the dog owl, and
then I thought I saw the coyote, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>

<p>“Shot at a coyote? That was no way to do!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t know but ’twas mebbe a man.”</p>

<p>They took him down into the camp, where Snaky
Pete was nervously awaiting their report. Snaky Pete
questioned him, and inspected his throat.</p>

<p>“Finger prints there, it looks like,” he said. “’Twas
a man. And if a man, then ’twas an enemy, er he
wouldn’t slid out that way. Mebbe there aire more
of ’em up there. Strengthen the guards, and every
man stand to his post.”</p>

<p>Old Nick Nomad, lying in the doorway of the hut,
was listening for some other sound from Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“What was the meanin’ of that?” Pizen Jane asked
him, after the helpless sentry had been brought in.</p>

<p>Nomad was silent, and she repeated her question.</p>

<p>“I might say, if I thought I could trust ye.”</p>

<p>“I’ll prove to ye that you can,” she said; “though
I’m doin’ jes’ what I have been meanin’ to do all day.”
She bent over him and cut the cords that held him, and
then slipped the knife into his hands. “Now, what
was it?”</p>

<p>“Buffler Bill,” said Nomad. “He was out thar.
Thet war his signal ter me; and I answered it.”</p>

<p>“He’s got men with him?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Mebbe he has, and mebbe he ain’t. But
he’s silent now, and prob’bly has cut out, seein’ that the
force hyar is too big fer him. But you bet he’ll be
comin’ back ag’in; and when he does, somethin’ will
be doin’.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE LIVING BARRICADE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In one way, it was unfortunate that Pizen Jane had
released old Nomad at that time. A road agent who
had heard the cry of the dog owl from the hut, and
wondered about it, came over to investigate, and appeared
so suddenly and inopportunely that he discovered
what Pizen Jane had done. With a yell of astonishment
and wrath, he hurled the woman aside and
leaped on the old trapper.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions, Nomad might have engaged
this desperado successfully; but now his arms
and legs were benumbed, and his whole body was sore
and stiff, from the long congestion of blood caused by
the bonds that had been on him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though surprised, and taken at such a
disadvantage, the old trapper put up a stiff fight. He
slashed a wide gash in the outlaw’s face with the knife
Pizen Jane had given him; and then, tripping the outlaw,
he rolled with him over and over on the floor,
clawing and striking with all his might.</p>

<p>Pizen Jane flew to the aid of Nomad, and set upon
the road agent.</p>

<p>How the singular combat would have ended, if there
had been no interference, cannot be stated.</p>

<p>There was interference. Other outlaws, drawn by
the noise, ran to the hut; and in a very little while both
old Nomad and Pizen Jane were overpowered and
their weapons taken from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>Snaky Pete came to the hut, drawn by the yells of
his men, and learned what had happened. His rage
passed all bounds. He drew a revolver, and for an
instant it seemed that he meant to shoot both old
Nomad and Pizen Jane. Then another thought came
to him.</p>

<p>“Tie ’em, and keep ’em tied,” he said; “and send
Pool Clayton here. I want to see him bad.”</p>

<p>That sounded ominous.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton was called, and came forward with
fear and trembling. He had told his mother not long
before that he was willing to leave the outlaws, and
glad to do it, if she would accompany him. He had
been expecting that she would do that soon. It was
delayed, he thought, by the difficulty of getting out of
the camp.</p>

<p>The young man had been given a good deal of time
for serious reflection. His dreams of what a road
agent’s life was like had not come true; and, besides,
he had been aroused to a realization of the enormity
of the offense itself. In addition, his heart had been
touched by his mother.</p>

<p>But perhaps the strongest of the forces that had
moved him was a recollection of Snaky Pete’s commands
to him to shoot old Nomad. That, with his
present fear of personal danger in the battle with the
troopers that seemed imminent, had made him want
to get out of the camp without delay.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that his talks with his mother, and
even his thoughts and desires to get away, had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
known to Snaky Pete, when the latter sent for him,
commanding him sharply to appear at once.</p>

<p>On arriving at the hut, he saw Nomad and Pizen
Jane bound and prisoners. A startling fear that he
was to be commanded to shoot not only Nomad but
his mother came to terrify him.</p>

<p>“Tie him!” Snaky Pete roared.</p>

<p>The road agents threw themselves upon the fear-stricken
youth, quickly subdued him, and bound him.
Then Snaky Pete took occasion to explain to his men
just what he meant to do.</p>

<p>“Buffalo Bill thinks mighty well, seems to me, of
them three people,” he said, pointing to the three prisoners.
“It’s my opinion that Pool and his mother got
in here on purpose to betray the band, and lead enemies
to it. In my jedgment, they’d have done something
to-night, by way of weakenin’ the barricades,
mebbe, that would have got us all killed er captured.”</p>

<p>The murmurs of the desperadoes rose unpleasantly
as they listened to these accusations.</p>

<p>“I been watchin’ Pool ever sence he refused to shoot
that old duffer there when I ordered him to. That’s
one p’int in the proof that he is ole Nomad’s friend
and Cody’s friend; and that woman I know to be the
pizenest rattlesnake in many ways that ever crawled
on the earth.</p>

<p>“Jes’ the same, I ain’t goin’ to shoot ’em&mdash;not now!
I want ’em put up in front of the barricades, where the
troopers can see ’em; and then, if the soldiers want to
shoot into the barricades, let ’em do it.”</p>

<p>It was a long speech, and its utterance cost him effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and pain; yet he felt savagely gratified by it. He had
determined on the death of Pizen Jane, and of Pool
Clayton and Nick Nomad.</p>

<p>If the troopers, in trying to take the barricades,
killed the three, well and good; for a time he hoped
their position there would hold the soldiers back. If
the prisoners were not thus slain, he would have them
shot as enemies after the coming fight was over. He
still had confidence in his men and in the strength of
his position, and was feverishly vengeful and defiant.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton wilted and cried out for mercy when
he was dragged by the road agents out to one of the
barricades, and was lifted over it and tied to the logs
of which it was composed. His mother was tied by
his side. They were on the outside of the barricade,
and looked up the dark pass, where they half expected
to see soon the flaming of the carbines of troopers.</p>

<p>Placed thus, where the rain of lead could not miss
them, it seemed to Pool Clayton that his end was at
hand. He cried out in bitterness and anguish of spirit,
reproaching himself for the evil course which had led
to this horrible fate.</p>

<p>“Pool,” said Pizen Jane, touched by his moaning
outcries, “there aire things that aire a heap worse’n to
die this way; and one of the things that aire worse is
bein’ a successful road agent. Fer that is a thing that
would shore destroy you, body and soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk that way!” he wailed. “Don’t talk
that way! We must escape! We must get away!”</p>

<p>He threw himself to and fro in his agonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p>One of the outlaws came climbing over the barricade.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said, “if you don’t stop that yelpin’,
I’ve got orders to gag ye. Now, will you stop?”</p>

<p>Pool Clayton stopped, but lay shivering against the
logs, white-faced and wild-eyed, overcome by terror.</p>

<p>At the other barricade Nick Nomad had been tied in
the same way.</p>

<p>But Nomad was showing no cowardly spirit. He
believed in Buffalo Bill’s ability to accomplish even
wonders, and he therefore had hope.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE GALLANT TROOPERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill scaled successfully the slope of the
mountain above the outlaw camp and got away.</p>

<p>He heard the uproar in the camp, and was almost
tempted to turn back, fearing for the life of Nick
Nomad; but he went on. He did not really see how
he could help Nomad without at the same time putting
his own life in such jeopardy that the risk could not
be justified.</p>

<p>Two hours later he reached his horse, which he
mounted, and then shaped his course by the stars in
the direction of the camp of troopers.</p>

<p>Midnight was long past when he reached their camp
and reported his discoveries.</p>

<p>“I must have half an hour’s sleep,” he said, “and
while I am getting it have everything made ready for
an immediate advance.”</p>

<p>He dropped down by one of the fires, in his clothing,
and was sleeping almost at once, as soundly as
a child.</p>

<p>The lieutenant in command of the troopers awoke
him at the end of his brief nap. Then, once more,
the redoubtable scout was in the saddle, this time leading
the troopers forth toward the discovered camp of
the desperadoes of the Sepulcher Mountains.</p>

<p>The men under Buffalo Bill gained the base of the
mountain over against the outlaw camp shortly before
daylight, having ridden hard to accomplish it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p>There the horses were left, one man out of four
dropping back to hold them, while the other three went
forward. Buffalo Bill again led the advance, up the
slopes of the mountain.</p>

<p>His spying of the previous afternoon had convinced
him of the folly of trying to take those barricades by
assault. He did not doubt the courage and ability of
the troopers, than whom braver men never lived, but
it would have been criminal, he felt, to ask them to
lay down their lives in front of those deadly barricades
when the camp might be taken in an easier way.
His plan was to climb the mountain, and descend in
the darkness just before the dawn upon the outlaw
camp, endeavoring by this descent and the suddenness
of the attack to surprise and stampede its defenders.</p>

<p>In spite of his strenuous efforts to get down the slope
while the darkness was densest, the very fact that the
darkness was so great kept the scout from doing this.
For the descent had to be made with caution; and,
consequently, was made with wearying slowness.</p>

<p>The gray dawn was in the east when the troopers
crouched like mountain lions on the rocky ground that
overhung the outlaw camp.</p>

<p>Down in the camp there was some kind of stir,
though what it meant could not be determined. In the
gray light the shapes of the low huts were almost
indistinguishable. The sentries that the scout knew
were there could not be seen, for not a light flickered,
and no camp-fire glow was seen. Nevertheless, he
was sure that behind the barricades the outlaws were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
waiting and watching, and that alert sentinels were
making their ceaseless and vigilant rounds.</p>

<p>Suddenly a single revolver shot sounded down in the
camp, breaking with startling clearness on the still
air of the dawn. Following it there was an excited
clamor.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill did not know what that shot meant.
He realized that it might be a signal that he and the
troopers had been discovered. Yet he did not hesitate,
but gave instantly the command to charge, hoping
to gain some advantage by the excitement and confusion
into which the outlaws seemed to have been
thrown.</p>

<p>The troopers leaped, some sliding and rolling, down
the bowldered slope. Then their charging cheer rose,
and their carbines flamed and cracked as they gained
the lower ground, and rushed upon the huts they now
beheld before them.</p>

<p>Most of the outlaws were at the moment behind the
barricades which defended the two sides of the camp,
at the entrances of the pass. Some of them, however,
were in or near one of the huts, and, with wild
yells, they tried to meet the onset of the charging
troopers.</p>

<p>At the head of the troopers was seen the tall form
of Buffalo Bill, as, with revolver in hand, he led the
charge.</p>

<p>Desperadoes went down under the fire of the troopers,
and troopers fell, shot by desperadoes; and then
the troopers were in the midst of the huts, and the
battle was on in all its fury.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="fs70">A WOMAN’S VENGEANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The shot which Buffalo Bill and the troopers heard,
and which was followed by their advance, was fired
by Pizen Jane.</p>

<p>Perhaps because she was a woman the cords that
bound her wrists and held her to the barricade were
not knotted as securely and tightly as those that bound
her son. Men were desperate and low indeed when
they do not, consciously or unconsciously, retain some
consideration for a woman.</p>

<p>Pizen Jane had discovered, after a time, that she
could work her wrists about in the cords. She had
said nothing of her discovery, for outlaws were near
her, behind the barricade; and out in front paced a
sentry.</p>

<p>But she had begun to strain and tug at the cords,
finding by and by that they gave a little.</p>

<p>This added to her desire to get out of them, and
to that task she bent her endeavors.</p>

<p>Yet a long time went by before she again felt the
cords slip and give under her manipulation.</p>

<p>After she was able to draw out one hand she stood
for some time in silence, considering what she could
do. Apparently, she could do nothing, because of the
men near by.</p>

<p>She did not dare to speak of what she had done to
Pool, lest she should be overheard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p>After that, as she had waited, hoping for something
that would create a diversion of which she could take
advantage, the slow-moving time had seemed interminable.</p>

<p>But Pizen Jane was possessed of monumental patience.</p>

<p>She had waited, minute by minute and hour by hour,
hoping that something would turn in her favor.</p>

<p>At intervals she had strained at the cords which still
held one wrist, and at last freed it. Her feet were
still tied at the ankles, and her body was still bound
to the barricade.</p>

<p>She grew desperate when she saw the gray dawn
breaking, and knew that day was near, when inevitably
what she had done would be discovered.</p>

<p>She began to strain at the cords on her ankles; and
at length, in her desperation, she stooped over, determined
to untie them with her hands.</p>

<p>The sentinel out in front saw her do this.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said. “What ye doin’?”</p>

<p>She stood erect by the barricade, her hands behind
her back once more, her lips firmly compressed, and
did not answer him.</p>

<p>Long before, Pool Clayton had become little better
than a shaking jelly bag, through excess of fright. He
hardly knew what the man said, and he had not discovered
what his courageous mother was doing.</p>

<p>The man walked up to the barricade, and, stooping
over, looked Pizen Jane in the face.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he repeated. “What you doin’?”</p>

<p>Then her hands flew out, and, catching the knife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
from his belt, she drove it into his shoulder, inflicting
a wound that tumbled him back, gasping and half paralyzed.</p>

<p>Before the outlaws on the other side of the barricade
knew just what had occurred, Pizen Jane had cut
the cords that held her, had stricken loose those that
bound Pool Clayton, and was climbing over the barricade,
the knife and the sentry’s revolver in her
hands.</p>

<p>“Git out o’ my way!” she snarled, striking at one of
the men who sought to oppose her progress.</p>

<p>He fell back out of the way of the knife. Then
she sprang down, and in another instant she was running
toward the huts.</p>

<p>One of the outlaws pitched up a rifle and was on
the point of shooting her.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it!” a companion warned, and he knocked
the muzzle of the gun aside. “The boss would raise
Old Ned wi’ ye, if ye should.”</p>

<p>Though they feared to shoot, a couple of them followed
her; but when they reached the huts, though
they had followed close at her heels, they could not
find her.</p>

<p>One of them poked his head into the hut where
Snaky Pete was lying, supposedly asleep.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he called, in a low voice. “That woman
has got away, and is in the camp here some’eres.”</p>

<p>Snaky Pete came to his feet, and rushed to the door.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” he cried, his wounded lip cutting
him like a knife as he said it.</p>

<p>“Here!” was the startling answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>Pizen Jane seemed to rise out of the ground before
him. She threw up the revolver, and fired full at him.
It was the revolver shot that the scout and the troopers
heard.</p>

<p>As its report rang out, Snaky Pete Sanborn, the
outlaw and desperado, pitched forward on his face,
falling dead in the door of the hut.</p>

<p>Pizen Jane had kept her vow.</p>

<p>The charge of the troopers came right on top of
this, turning the attention of the outlaws to the task
of repulsing the invaders. The fight that followed
was sharp and hot, but it was short.</p>

<p>Finding that the troopers were within the camp
itself, the desperadoes stationed at the barricades deserted
them, climbing them and running for safety out
through the pass.</p>

<p>Those within the camp, who had been trapped there,
fought with a courage and desperation worthy of a
better cause. They slew some of the troopers, and
several of their own number fell.</p>

<p>The others tried to get out of the camp, but, being
surrounded, they threw down their weapons and surrendered.</p>

<p>The shrill voice of Pizen Jane was heard once, as
she took part in the fight against the outlaws; and once
the scout beheld her, with smoking pistol, confronting
one of the outlaws. When the fight had ended she was
found lying dead close by the hut where she had killed
her infamous and recreant husband.</p>

<p>Nomad was, of course, released from his unpleasant
predicament. He received orders to remain a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
hours longer at the camp, in order to observe whether
any of the deserters returned with reënforcements&mdash;in
which case he was to ride at once to Fort Thompson.
If none returned, he could rejoin Buffalo Bill
and the troopers at the fort, within the next three days.</p>

<p>Pool Clayton seemed genuinely grieved over the
death of his mother, and shed bitter tears when he
beheld her dead body. He was not held for the crime
of being a member of the road-agent band, but was
permitted to depart from that section of the country.</p>

<p>That a genuine reformation in his character was
effected the scout believed, for afterward he had word
of him, at a time when Pool was residing in a mining
town called Crystal Spring, where he had secured honorable
employment and seemed determined to live an
honest life.</p>

<span class="fs70">PURSUED BY BLACKFEET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Whoa, Nebby, consarn ye! Don’t lose yer head,
now, er mighty quick you won’t have no head to lose.”</p>

<p>Old Nick Nomad, the trapper and famous border
scout, twisted around in his saddle, jerking at his
horse’s bridle, and stared back along the way he had
come after leaving the outlaw stronghold.</p>

<p>Nomad was a small, dried-up specimen of a man,
dressed in border costume of ancient fashion, even to
the beaver-skin cap. He held in his right hand a long
rifle. His old horse, ungainly as himself, yet possessed
of as many surprising qualities, stepped about,
in spite of the jerking rein, and showed every indication
of nervousness and fright.</p>

<p>“You’re skittisher’n a two-year-old, and ain’t got
any more sense, when you smells Injuns,” Nick grumbled.
“Stand still, now; they’re comin’ erlong, I know,
but they ain’t nigh enough ter bite ye!”</p>

<p>Old Nebuchadnezzar had made a rapid run since the
Blackfeet were sighted, more than two miles back. The
homely, shaggy-haired beast had been too fleet for the
Blackfeet ponies. His sides were heaving now, and
sweat trickled down his legs, dripping to the ground.
Yet he was ready to go on; and so much did he fear
Indians that he would have run until he fell, if Nomad
had but given him rein and urged him a little.</p>

<p>Nomad was trying to determine whether the Blackfeet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
were coming on, following his trail, or whether
they had left the trail and were trying to cut him off at
some narrow pass. They were more familiar with
this part of the country than he was, and he knew in
that they possessed a decided advantage.</p>

<p>After a time of quiet, the Blackfeet had once more
become troublesome, under Crazy Snake, whose hatred
of the whites had flared forth with sudden fury.</p>

<p>Nomad had, for two days, returned to the old life
he loved best of all&mdash;trapping by the headwaters of
the mountain streams, leading a carefree existence in
the open and under the blue sky.</p>

<p>Then, on the last day&mdash;the day on which he was to
arrive at the fort&mdash;trouble and peril had descended on
him when he had least expected it.</p>

<p>His traps were stolen or destroyed, his little hut
was broken open and robbed, and then Paul Davis, his
old-time border partner, who had encountered him in
the neighborhood of the outlaws’ stronghold, was
slain, while returning one afternoon to the hut from
a hunt.</p>

<p>Nomad found Davis’ body in the trail that led
down from the higher mountains, and on Davis’ breast
a bloody arrow, slashed there with a scalping knife.</p>

<p>The scalp had been torn from Davis’ head, thus
proving that the work had been done by Blackfeet,
while the bloody arrow showed that this was another
“vengeance” blow struck by the chief, Crazy Snake.</p>

<p>Old Nomad was not fool enough to linger there
longer. He buried the body of his old friend, protecting
it from wolves by a heap of stones placed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the grave. Then he cached his pelts, picked his few
belongings, mounted old Nebuchadnezzar, and set his
face toward Fort Thompson.</p>

<p>But he was not to escape so easily.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he discovered that Blackfeet
were dogging his trail, for the apparent purpose
of surprising him in camp, or while he slept. He was
sure these Blackfeet were led by Crazy Snake, who
had marked him for another victim.</p>

<p>As Nomad sat staring along the backward way, a
herd of elk came in sight, swinging down the trail
he had been following. He instantly guided Nebuchadnezzar
out of the trail, and let the elk go plunging
by, for they seemed to be frightened, and were running
at high speed.</p>

<p>“Good enough!” the old man grunted. “I think I
kin puzzle them red devils a bit now.”</p>

<p>Sure that wherever the Blackfeet were they did not
now see him, Nomad dismounted, and, removing a
blanket he carried in a roll behind his saddle, he tore
it into strips <ins class="corr" id="tn111" title="Transcriber’s Note—“and wrapped them round the roofs” changed to “and wrapped them round the hoofs”.">and wrapped them round the hoofs</ins>
of his horse, so that he would leave no trail.</p>

<p>A trailless route would make it troublesome for even
the keen-eyed Blackfeet to follow him.</p>

<p>Descending the mountain now by a zigzag path, and
making, besides, several changes in his course, Nomad
succeeded in reaching lower ground. Here he mounted
Nebuchadnezzar again, and rode off in a new direction;
but several times changed his course, in his efforts
to baffle the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>While he was thus riding on, he was astonished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
hearing his name spoken. He reined in and faced
about, staring in surprise.</p>

<p>“By ther great jumpin’ jack rabbits, ef that ain’t
ther queerest ever!” he grunted. “Somebody callin’
ter me hyer, at a p’int whar thar ain’t nobody!”</p>

<p>A pebble came rolling down the side of the hill, the
suddenness with which it bounced out at him making
him jump. He saw that it had come from a clump of
aspens on the hillside not far away.</p>

<p>His ancient rifle swung around with a quick motion,
and the muzzle was elevated toward the aspens.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Don’t shoot,” a voice called. “Like
Davy Crockett’s coon, I’ll come down.”</p>

<p>Then a hand appeared, pushing some leaves aside,
and, following this hand, came the body of a man.</p>

<p>Nomad gasped his amazement when he saw the
clothing and face of this man. Before him stood Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>Though Nomad’s astonishment was deep, he did
not forget the peril in which he was placed at that
time.</p>

<p>“Stand whar ye aire, Buffler!” he called. “The pizen
reds aire rompin’ round, and aire after my ha’r. Ole
Crazy Snake is reachin’ fer me with his fangs.”</p>

<p>He guided his horse up to the aspens where the
scout stood; the scout asking questions, which he did
not then answer.</p>

<p>“Buffler, I’m gladder ter see ye than ef I’d found a
gold mine! Got yer hoss hyar?”</p>

<p>“Yes; just back here in ther trees.”</p>

<p>“Then, fer Heaven’s sake, muffle him, and git out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
with me, ’fore ther reds finds this spot,” the old trapper
urged. “I’m huntin’ fer a hole ter hide in, till Crazy
Snake and his Blackfeet villyuns leave this kentry;
and it’ll be healthy fer you ter do ther same quick’s
ye kin.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill did not know until then that Crazy
Snake had actually taken to the warpath, though he
had known there were rumors of war trouble, and that
a number of whites had been murdered. He shook
hands with old Nomad, and asked him some more
questions. This time Nomad answered:</p>

<p>“I’ve give ’em a good start, and balled ’em some,
Buffler, but they ain’t easy ter fool.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Nomad,” the scout answered; “but I
think we can fool them.”</p>

<p>He retreated to where his horse was tied to an
aspen; and then, taking a blanket from his roll, he
made mufflers like those used by Nomad. He looked
anxiously at the trail his horse had made in coming to
this little grove&mdash;some of the hoofmarks deeply scored
the soil. But there was no help for that now.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he joined Nomad, mounted, and
asked:</p>

<p>“Were you making for the cañon down there?”</p>

<p>“Anywhar, Buffler, ter fool ther Blackfeet. If yer
knows this kentry some I’ll let you p’int ther way, fer
bur durned ef I’m any too well acquainted with it.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill took the lead.</p>

<p>As the two men rode along, they discussed the pursuit
of the Blackfeet, and each learned the story of
the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>“I came here from the fort on a scouting trip,” said
Buffalo Bill, “because the Blackfeet have killed some
men and have been threatening trouble. Since I arrived,
a miner was murdered and scalped on the Baldface
trail, and a sheep-herder was treated the same way
over in Los Cerillos Valley. Both were slain by Blackfeet;
yet I didn’t know whether it was simply some
single Blackfoot murderer, or was the work of Blackfeet
bands of rovers. I rode out here to-day, hoping
to find out something more about it.”</p>

<p>“And now y’ve found, Buffler! The red devils aire
risin’, and they’re killin’ and scalpin’. Ole Crazy
Snake’s bloody arrer will be on the breasts of a good
many dead men, ef ther thing continners, I’m tellin’
ye. I thought it war time fer me ter cut sticks, and so
I did. I’m glad I met ye, Buffler.”</p>

<p>The scout recounted many of the things that had
happened during the past three days, especially the departure
of young Clayton, and Nomad told of his
trapping experiences.</p>

<p>“I cached what furs I’d got tergether,” he said,
“when I was ready to slide out o’ the hills. If ther
Blackfeet don’t find ’em, I’ll git ’em some time. Ther
thing jes’ now is ter take keer o’ my scalp, which is a
good deal more important than a beaver skin, handsome
as a beaver skin looks.”</p>

<p>He pushed back his cap and scratched at his head,
as if it itched in anticipation of a scalping knife.</p>

<p>They sought lower ground as they talked, and they
talked in low tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>“Nomad, it’s providential that I met you,” the scout
told his old friend.</p>

<p>“I dunno about it, Buffler,” said Nomad, with a grin.
“If I’d gone straight ahead ’thout tryin’ to break my
trail, ole Crazy Snake’s band would have follered me
hot-footed. And so they wouldn’t never had a chance
ter see you hyar an’ put you in danger. Now they
may; fer they’ll pick up thet trail o’ mine, if mortual
man kin do it.”</p>

<p>With the scout in the lead, they entered the cañon.</p>

<p>On the rocks just by the water they removed the
mufflers from the hoofs of the horses. The animals
were then ridden into the water, the rocky bank there
holding no trail; and down the stream they rode, keeping
in the water. They went on in this way nearly
a mile, and then began to follow up a tributary stream.</p>

<p>As the scout rode along, his keen eyes searching
either shore, he saw a grove of trees. There were a
number of these groves in the lower part of the cañon,
whose floor was of soil in places, rather than rock.</p>

<p>“If we can get under cover of those trees without
making any tracks doing it, we can probably lie safe
there,” he remarked, while Nomad looked at the grove.</p>

<p>“Ole Nebby, hyar, kin do ’most anything, Buffler,
but he ain’t learnt to fly yit. And, without flyin’, I
don’t see how you’re goin’ ter git inter the midst of
them trees and leave no sign. Fer thar’s soil hyar,
and not rock.”</p>

<p>“But the grass, you’ll notice, come right down to
the water,” said the scout, “and is a thick, firm turf.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Buffler; I’m follerin’ ye. Mebbe we kin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
make it by mufflering ther hoofs of ther hosses. But
we can’t muffler ’em very well hyar in ther water, and
when we rides out of ther stream with their hoofs
bare they’re shore goin’ ter make some tracks.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill rode toward the shore.</p>

<p>When close to the grass, but still in the water, he
rose to his horse’s back. Standing in the saddle, with
the remaining blanket from his roll held in his hands,
he threw the blanket so that it fell on the grass at the
water’s edge. It fell, folded, as he had wanted it to;
and, with a quick jump, he leaped to it from the saddle.
By this clever plan, he kept his boots from cutting into
the turf and soil.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a blanket, in addition to the scraps you
cut the other one into,” he said. “Throw me your
blanket.”</p>

<p>Nomad threw the blanket to him, and the scout
spread it out beside the one on which he was standing.</p>

<p>He kept his feet off the ground, while he arranged
both blankets in the form of a carpet, which touched
the very rim of the water. Then he spoke to his well-trained
horse, and the obedient animal walked from
the water out upon the carpet of blankets. There the
scout put on the animal’s hoofs the mufflers, and then
commanded it to walk on, ordering it to stop when it
had gone far enough.</p>

<p>“Now, Nomad,” he called, “ride old Nebby out upon
this carpet, and when we’ve put the mufflers on him I
think the trick will be nearly done.”</p>

<p>Nick Nomad complied, dismounting beside his horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
on the blankets. The mufflers were put upon the hoofs
of Nebuchadnezzar. Then the old man rode him on.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill called his horse back to him, climbed
into the saddle, stooped from the saddle, and picked
the blankets from the ground, and called the trapper’s
attention to the apparent success of the ruse.</p>

<p>The blankets and the muffled hoofs had prevented
the showing of a single hoofmark by the margin of the
stream. More than that, they had absorbed the water
which ran from the legs of the horses, sucking it up
as a sponge would, and holding it; so that not even
water remained on the grass there to draw the attention
of any eagle-eyed Blackfoot.</p>

<p>The scout and the trapper now rode their muffled
horses into the thick grove, where they were completely
hidden from view of any one passing along the cañon
stream, or on either of its banks.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” said Nomad, filled with delight at the
cleverness of his old pard, “ef I’d had head enough I
might have thought o’ thet myself; but I didn’t. But
I allow thet it’s ther cutest trick I ever saw played
ter try ter fool Injuns. Whar’d yer learn it?”</p>

<p>“I thought of it myself just now. I don’t know
that any one ever tried it before. And that’s what
makes it valuable. If we used some trick that is
familiar the Blackfeet would probably be expecting it,
and so would not be fooled by it. They’ll not be expecting
this trick, I hope.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE BLACKFOOT TRAILERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Under cover of the screening trees, Buffalo Bill and
old Nomad watched the cañon and stream, while they
talked of the threatened Blackfoot war, and of their
individual experiences since they had last been together.</p>

<p>“It warn’t Blackfeet we war up ag’inst last time together,
Buffler, but road agents. Pool Clayton was
with us then, you recomember? D’yer think he’ll be
in this hyar neighborhood soon?”</p>

<p>“I’m not expecting him this time.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill told his old mountain pard, however,
that Pawnee Bill, the famous dead shot, was to have
joined him in the town below, but had missed him
there, and would no doubt follow.</p>

<p>“It’s just possible,” he had stated, “that he went
round by way of the Ferguson Trail, and, if so, he
may have gained these hills in advance of my coming;
yet I think he is behind me.”</p>

<p>As the two friends talked thus, Buffalo Bill laid
his hand with a quick, firm motion on Nomad’s arm.
Reaching out with the other hand, he took his horse
by the nose.</p>

<p>“Hist!” came from his lips.</p>

<p>Nomad understood, glanced at the stream, and
patted the nose of old Nebuchadnezzar to keep him
still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>A Blackfoot warrior had come in sight on the other
side of the little cañon river. He was naked, save for
a breechclout, and his copper-colored body was
smeared and striped with paint. He carried a long
rifle, and a knife, and hatchet. In his raven hair eagle
feathers fluttered, proclaiming him not only a warrior,
but, with the abundant paint, announcing that he
was on the warpath.</p>

<p>He had come downstream, and he was scanning the
river and its shores, and the cañon walls, together with
the wider expanses where the little groves of trees
were. But most he gave his attention to the banks of
the stream at the water’s edge.</p>

<p>It was plain to the experienced bordermen that if
he had not tracked the white men to the cañon and the
river, he at least suspected they had gone there, and he
was looking for the point where they had emerged.
His presence was proof that other Blackfeet were near,
and no doubt a strong war party. They had chased
old Nomad, and were ready for scalps and plunder.</p>

<p>The concealed friends and their horses stood motionless,
as the Indian stepped with light feet along the
farther shore of the little river.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn119" title="Transcriber’s Note—“He was a magnificent speciment” changed to “He was a magnificent specimen”.">He was a magnificent specimen</ins>
of the American Indian; lithe, as well as muscular, his body straight
as an arrow, his limbs sinewy, yet so gracefully and evenly developed
that they would have done as models for a sculptor or a painter.
Buffalo Bill looked at the Blackfoot with admiration, regarding him
at the moment merely as a fine specimen of Indian manhood,
forgetting in that momentary enthusiasm what his appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
there meant, and what was denoted by the
paint and the floating feathers.</p>

<p>The Indian stared hard at the trees which concealed
the scout and the trapper. He neither saw nor heard
anything there. On the ground between the river and
the grove there was not so much as an indentation in
the soil to suggest that horses had passed that way.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Nebby, consarn ye!” Nomad whispered to
his horse; for Nebby’s ears were pricked up and his
big eyes were staring. Indians frightened him, for
which Nomad was responsible, for he had taught the
old horse to fear them.</p>

<p>“Nebby is better’n any watchdog,” was Nomad’s
boast. “No Injun kin come nigh him without him
makin’ a hullabaloo.”</p>

<p>This tendency to make a “hullabaloo” when he saw
an Indian had its disadvantages at times, as at present;
yet the whispered adjurations of old Nomad, and
the touch of his hand, kept the horse quiet as the
Blackfoot passed along. As for the scout’s horse,
though it had not Nebby’s peculiar tendency, there was,
nevertheless, danger that it would make a noise of
some kind, hence the scout kept his hand on its nose.</p>

<p>After staring hard at the grove, and scanning the
soil by the stream, the Blackfoot went on, and soon he
was lost to sight in a bend of the cañon.</p>

<p>“A close shave!” said the scout.</p>

<p>“And a healthy one fer thet red nigger, Buffler,” said
Nomad meaningly. “I’d hate fer him to ’a’ smelt us
out hyar, fer then I’d had to shot him. And that
would ’a’ made a tarnal noise, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; we’d have been in for a fight.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s more of ’em about, Buffler.”</p>

<p>“They may be a good deal scattered, though; so we
may see only this fellow.”</p>

<p>“I’m hopin’ it, Buffler.”</p>

<p>They saw another, in a very few seconds, on their
side of the stream. He was armed and painted like the
one who had just disappeared, but he was not so tall
and handsome. His body was shorter and thicker, his
arms longer, his sheer physical strength greater. He
could not have run like the one who had just gone
on, but in a rough-and-tumble fight he would have been
an enemy more to be feared.</p>

<p>He not only looked at the grove where the white
men were hidden with their horses, but he walked a
few yards toward it, looking carefully at the ground.</p>

<p>Once or twice he stooped down and inspected the
grass; and the scout and trapper thought then he had
seen some faint indentations in the soil, and guessed of
the trick that had been played. But the redskin retraced
his way to the river, and went on, searching its
shores.</p>

<p>“Phew, Buffler! I thought it war fight, shore thing,
then!”</p>

<p>“I, too.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we’re safe hyar, unless they come back
and take a notion to look behind these trees. If they
does it, thar will be dead Injuns, and fun immediately
afterward.”</p>

<p>The Blackfeet did not return. An hour passed, and
then another, and nothing was seen or heard; but Cody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and Nomad could not be sure that sharp eyes were not
watching the cañon from some cliff or cañon precipice;
hence they remained concealed in the grove, keeping
the horses as quiet as possible, and talking only in low
tones.</p>

<p>Not until darkness came did they venture to leave
their secure retreat. Even then they moved with the
utmost caution, leading the horses instead of riding
them, and progressing so slowly that hours elapsed
before they came out into the open country below.
There the land lay broad and free before them, and
the stars pointed the way.</p>

<p>Yet they did not ride toward the town. Instead,
they turned back into the hills; for the discovery
that the Blackfeet had taken the warpath under
Crazy Snake made the scout fearful for the safety of
a family he knew, who lived just under the shadows
of the big hills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE TRAGEDY OF THE CABIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The home of John Forest was a simple and unpretentious
one, but it was lighted by the beauty of a girl
whom he loved as his own life, his daughter Lena.</p>

<p>Forest was lured by that witch of the world&mdash;gold.
He believed he had found gold at the foot of Big Tom
Mountain, gold in quantities to pay not only for working
the mine he soon opened there, but enough to make
him rich. He had a brother who had found good ore
in a region not many miles away, and his brother’s
success encouraged him to “stick it out” even to the
bitter end.</p>

<p>The country was forbidding, and the Blackfeet were
not far away; yet Forest established his home under
the shadow of the mountain, installed in it his daughter
as his housekeeper, and set to work.</p>

<p>Like many mines, there was far more promise in the
Lady Bird, as he called it, than there was performance.
He took out barely enough gold to give him a
living and supply him with tools and blasting powder.
Daily he kept hoping to strike the “mother lode,”
or a seam of gold, or, perhaps, a pocket of nuggets.</p>

<p>He paid little heed to the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>As for callers or visitors, he had a few; one of them
being young Bruce Clayton, who had fallen in love
with the beautiful face of the miner’s daughter, and
who came there as frequently as his new “job” permitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>Down in the town of Crystal Spring, some miles
away, on one of her infrequent visits, Lena Forest
learned of the trouble brewing with the Blackfeet, and
its cause.</p>

<p>It was a singular story, as she regarded it.</p>

<p>Some white miners had established themselves near
Crazy Snake’s village; which, to the Indian mind, was
bad of itself; and then one of the miners, falling ill of
measles, and not knowing what it was, the disease had
been communicated to the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Treated by Indian medicine men, whose sole idea of
medication was to rattle tomtoms and howl themselves
hoarse in efforts to drive away malignant spirits, the
Blackfeet died like flies. One of the victims of this
scourge of the measles was Crazy Snake’s only son.</p>

<p>Believing that the white men had sent this curse on
the Blackfeet for the purpose of destroying them, that
they might secure the Indian lands for mining purposes,
Crazy Snake and some of his warriors attacked
the miners’ camp, and slew all in it, including the man
who was ill of measles, but who was at the time convalescing.
Not content with this summary vengeance,
Crazy Snake was now threatening the white people
everywhere.</p>

<p>The mark of his visitation was an arrow of blood
scored with a knife on the breast of each victim.</p>

<p>This was the startling story Lena Forest brought
home to her father.</p>

<p>“The Blackfeet will not trouble us here,” said Forest.
“I don’t think they know we’re here, anyway;
for not one has come near us all the time we’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
here. But if trouble seems threatening, we’ll cut out
in time to escape it.”</p>

<p>The truth is, that though Forest feared more than
he would say, he believed he was at the moment on the
verge of opening up that wonderful seam of gold, and
the golden lure chained him there. Every day, even
every hour, he was sure that the next stroke or two
of the pick, or the next few scrapes of his shovel,
would reveal the gleam of the shining metal for which
he had worked so hard!</p>

<p>No, he could not go just yet, even though Blackfeet
threatened. Besides, none had been seen near the
house, nor in the hills near it. Really, he tried to persuade
himself, there was no danger.</p>

<p>Lena Forest, uneasy, went to the town again, to gain
further news of the threatened Blackfoot trouble.</p>

<p>She learned that the danger was really alarming, and
that two noted scouts had been sent for, and had arrived&mdash;Buffalo
Bill and Pawnee Bill. Her father
knew these scouts, and Buffalo Bill was his personal
friend. She tried to see them, but found only Pawnee
Bill, Cody having departed for the hills.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill advised her that it was foolish for her
and her father to remain in their exposed home at
that time, and assured her he would call on her father
and tell him so.</p>

<p>The girl returned home, determined more than ever
to induce her father to go at once to the town, or to
some point of greater security.</p>

<p>When she rode along the path, approaching her
home in the gathering twilight, she saw before the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
a form lying in a limp heap, a sight that stilled her
heartbeats and caused her to reel in her saddle with
faintness. Nevertheless, she rode up to it, and, leaping
down by it, discovered her father, dead. He had
been killed and scalped; and on his breast, where the
blue flannel shirt had been torn open, was that dreadful
sight, the arrow of blood drawn with a scalping
knife.</p>

<p>The girl swooned at sight of it, and fell as if dead
beside the dead body.</p>

<p>How long she remained there unconscious she did
not know. The stars were in the sky and the wind
from the mountain was cold when she aroused and
came back to a realization of the terrible thing that
had befallen her father and herself.</p>

<p>She threw herself on the inanimate form, and wept
as if her eyes were oceans. By and by she struggled
to her feet.</p>

<p>Her first thought was of flight, for personal safety,
and for help for her father, whose body needed to be
protected from wolves and other wild beasts. But she
discovered that she had not strength to go anywhere;
and this, with thoughts of what might happen during
her absence, held her to the dreadful spot.</p>

<p>She crept at length to the cabin, where she procured
a candle. With it she returned to her father’s body.
Lighting the candle, she put it upright on the ground
beside him, knowing that wolves and other wild animals
fear such a light. Having done that, she returned
to the cabin, this time thinking of finding her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
horse, which had strayed away, and of riding to the
town with the news.</p>

<p>But she swooned again as she crossed the threshold,
and fell to the floor, where she lay a long while. This
time when she recovered she crawled to the bed, and
laid herself down on it. She slept, then; though how
or why she did was afterward a puzzle to her.</p>

<p>The sun was shining in through the open door when
a voice, the voice of a man, aroused her.</p>

<p>She got up, wild-eyed, her dress disheveled, her
face tear-stained.</p>

<p>The man was Pawnee Bill, whom she had seen and
talked with in the town. He had ridden out, as he
had promised, leaving the town long before dawn, and
he had seen in the trail the dead body of John Forest,
mute witness of the vengeance of Crazy Snake, the
Blackfoot. The famous scout soon saw that the girl
was on the verge of a collapse from hysteria and overwrought
nerves. She screamed when she beheld him,
ran toward him with outstretched hands, and in wild
phrases began to tell him of what had occurred.</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” he said, “you do not need to tell me,
for I have seen. But let me urge you to try to control
yourself. I shall escort you back to the town, and
then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But my father!” she wailed hysterically.</p>

<p>“All that can be done for him now will be done, let
me assure you.”</p>

<p>The kind-hearted scout was really at a loss what to
say and do in this dire emergency, but he induced her
to lie down again on the bed; and then he went outside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
thinking to get a spade and bury the body of
John Forest.</p>

<p>As he did so, he beheld two men coming along the
trail. He stared, then recognized them, and ran toward
them, calling their names.</p>

<p>They were Buffalo Bill and old Nick Nomad.</p>

<p>It was the family of John Forest that Buffalo Bill
had been anxious to warn against the dangers of the
Blackfeet.</p>

<span class="fs70">AN AMAZING DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lena Forest came out of the cabin when she heard
Pawnee Bill talking with the scouts and the trapper.
She recognized the scout, for once he had called on her
father, and she ran toward him.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you had but been here sooner!” she wailed.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill dismounted, and Nomad did the same.</p>

<p>“Yes, we came too late,” said the scout sadly. “I
have been talking with Major Lillie, and we think you
should be sent at once to the town. Major Lillie will
go with you, while my old friend, Nomad, and I will
pick up the trail of the Blackfeet murderers of your
father. That’s all that can be done now, except to
give your father decent burial, which we will do at
once.”</p>

<p>He took the girl by the hand, and his kind words
caused her tears to flow afresh.</p>

<p>“Now, if you will go back into the house and lie
down again for a while it will be better for you,” he
urged. “There is absolutely nothing you can do, and
you need as much rest as you can get before you start
on your trip. We will find your horse; and, if you
like, Nomad will go in and prepare something for you
to eat, or make some coffee for you.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t eat a mouthful,” she said.</p>

<p>“But you will go into the house?” he urged.</p>

<p>She understood, turned about with slow feet, and
disappeared within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>Pawnee Bill found the miner’s spade and pick, and
brought them out for the purpose of digging a grave,
which work he and the scout at once began, while old
Nomad set forth on Nebuchadnezzar for the purpose
of finding and capturing the girl’s runaway horse.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his friend worked rapidly, and soon
had a grave hollowed out. Buffalo Bill then went to
the house to get blankets in which to wrap the body
for burial.</p>

<p>When he entered the cabin, he was astonished not
to find the girl there. However, he thought she had
but stepped out, and he went to the door to look
around. When he failed to see her, he called to her.</p>

<p>To his repeated calls there was no answer.</p>

<p>He stepped out of the house, and walked around it.</p>

<p>Nowhere was the girl to be seen.</p>

<p>There was a rear door, which was unlocked, but was
not open, and a rear window, but the window had not
been disturbed.</p>

<p>Cody began to search the ground quickly with his
keen eyes. He saw a moccasin track by the rear door,
yet he was not sure but it had been made at the time
the master of the house had been killed. The house
had been entered then, and some things had been
taken, so the girl had declared. That more had not
been taken was a marvel to the experienced scout.</p>

<p>“Gordon, come here!” he called from the corner of
the house.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill dropped the spade he was wielding and
came running.</p>

<p>“The girl is gone,” said the scout. “I found her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
absent from the house, and I fail to see her anywhere.”
He looked at Pawnee Bill earnestly. “Was her mind
so affected, do you think, that she would slip out of
this back door and into the hills, there?” he asked. “If
not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?” said Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill pointed to the moccasin track.</p>

<p>“That is suggestive, if it is new; but it’s hard to tell
when it was made. The girl is gone. You heard me
call to her, and she has not appeared, nor answered.
If she did not go herself, some one took her. That’s
why I asked you that question.”</p>

<p>“Her mind was all right,” said Pawnee Bill anxiously.
“She was depressed and almost hysterical, but
not enough so to make her run away in that fashion,
or do anything rash.”</p>

<p>“Then we must investigate this moccasin track at
once. You’ll see that an Indian could have slipped up
to the house from the hills, and where we were working
we could not have seen him. He could have entered
by this rear door, and he could have carried
off the girl. The question is, did anything like that
occur?”</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill was one of the best of the border
trailers. He and the scout bent together to examine
that moccasin track, after they had scanned the hills
for signs there of Indians.</p>

<p>Soon they found another track, and then another,
and still another, all leading from the rear door in the
direction of the hills.</p>

<p>“They’re fresh,” said Buffalo Bill, pointing to a bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
grass blade, which had been crushed so recently that
sap was oozing from it.</p>

<p>“And look there!” said Pawnee Bill, picking up a
broken feather.</p>

<p>Where the feather was found they discovered indications
that a struggle had taken place, for the grass
was cut and torn, and the footmarks did not go straight
on; there had been an interruption of the progress of
the Indian.</p>

<p>“It’s clear as day now,” said the scout, rising and
looking about. “Some redskin stole to the cabin while
we were busy at the grave. He had seen her enter,
and discovered that he could reach the cabin without
being observed by us. The girl had lain down on her
bed, and was perhaps half asleep, or may have had
her head covered up. She did not see him, at any
rate, until it was impossible for her to cry out; though
his sudden appearance may have so frightened her that
she could not utter a sound. Then he picked her up
in his arms, perhaps choking her to make her keep
still, and he carried her away into the hills.”</p>

<p>His nostrils were dilating and his bright eyes had
become feverish, so strongly did this mental picture
of the dastardly outrage appeal to his sensibilities.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said Lillie. “That is an eagle
feather, broken, no doubt, when at this point the girl
made a fierce struggle to free herself. She tore out
the eagle feather; but she could not escape, for he was
too strong; and then, no doubt unconscious after that,
she was borne rapidly away.”</p>

<p>“That fellow can’t be more than half a mile from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
here even now,” said the scout. “We’ll have to follow
at once. I wish that Nomad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Even before he had finished expressing the wish that
Nomad was there, they heard his shout, and saw him
riding swiftly in on his old horse.</p>

<p>“Injuns!” he said, before drawing rein. “They’ve
captered the gal’s hoss and lit out with it.”</p>

<p>“Did you see them?” Buffalo Bill asked.</p>

<p>“No; didn’t need to; but I seen what they done,
and I seen their tracks, and the tracks of the hoss. I
follered on a ways, to make shore I wasn’t mistaken,
and then I rid ter tell ye.”</p>

<p>“The tracks were fresh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; made this mornin’. Buffler, thar’s Injuns
snoopin’ round hyar, and thet’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“More than the horse is gone,” said the scout; “the
girl herself is gone!”</p>

<p>Nomad stared at the scout, then gripped his rifle
and stared round.</p>

<p>“Tooken by Injuns?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s what Gordon and I make of it. Here
are moccasin tracks. We think the redskin stole into
the cabin while we were digging the grave, and came
on her perhaps while she was asleep. Anyway, the
thing was done so quietly we didn’t hear a sound.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the tracks, and to the eagle feather.</p>

<p>Old Nomad was for the moment almost too amazed
to speak.</p>

<p>“We’ve got ter foller her, Buffler!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and at once; and I was going to say to you
that if you will finish filling in the grave of John Forest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
we will follow this trail at once. Then you can
come on as fast as possible, and no doubt you’ll soon
overtake us.”</p>

<p>Nomad looked earnestly at the brown hills.</p>

<p>“Crazy Snake?” he said, voicing the name in the
thought of each.</p>

<p>“That’s our opinion; at any rate, the rascal was a
Blackfoot, as the feather and the tracks show. I
hardly think he had any warriors with him, or, at most,
he must have had only a few, or he would have tried
to tackle us and get our scalps.”</p>

<p>Nomad turned his horse about and rode to the
grave, where he slid out of his saddle.</p>

<p>They saw him at work vigorously with the spade, as
they took up the trail, after getting their horses.</p>

<p>The trail was not difficult to follow, until it entered
the rocky hills.</p>

<p>They progressed slowly, however, for they could not
be sure that an ambush had not been laid for them.</p>

<p>Hard as the trail was to follow in the hills, they
clung to it, finding it the tracks of but one Indian.</p>

<p>After a little while it bent back in a semicircle toward
the river, this showing that the redskin had
merely run into the hills to get the benefit of their
cover, and that his real destination was the river.</p>

<p>They followed on more rapidly, and some distance
below, where hills and trees would screen him from
sight of any one at the cabin, they found that his trail
converged more, and then went straight toward the
cañon stream.</p>

<p>Here the trail was so plain in the soft soil that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
were able to follow it at rapid speed, and soon came
to the river, where they found water on the rocks, and
other evidence to show that at this point the Blackfoot
had taken to a boat. It was certain he had gone down
the river, and not up; for to go up the river would
have forced him to pass so near to the cabin that he
would have been in danger of discovery, and, besides,
the work of pulling against the current would have
been no small labor.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to abandon the horses,” said the scout,
when they had ridden rapidly on for a half mile or
more down the river, finding the way growing rougher,
and the cañon walls contracting until the stream became
a walled torrent.</p>

<p>“Or go round, which may be a long journey!” said
Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>“And would be likely to let the rascally redskin slip
through our fingers. We’ll have to keep to the river,
even if we are forced to swim.”</p>

<p>As they talked, they heard Nomad approaching rapidly.
He had finished his work of burying and protecting
the body of John Forest, and then had followed
hard on the trail of his friends.</p>

<p>It took but a few words to convey to him all that
the scouts knew.</p>

<p>“We want you to ride to the town for help,” said
Buffalo Bill to him. “Raise a strong force, and come
on as fast with it as you can. We’ll stick to this trail.
But we’re likely to get into trouble, and we’ll need
fighting men, in my opinion, before we accomplish
much. The rascal had beaten us temporarily, by taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to the water here; and unless we can get a boat
we’re going to have hard work to overtake him.”</p>

<p>“I’m bettin’ it’s Crazy Snake!”</p>

<p>“So we think, though we don’t know it. Spread the
news of the rising of the Blackfeet, and hurry with
a force to help us, or avenge us.”</p>

<p>The last were ominous words from Buffalo Bill, and
proved that he appreciated the dangerous character of
the undertaking upon which he now thought of entering.</p>

<p>Nomad wheeled old Nebuchadnezzar in the trail.</p>

<p>“Right ye aire, Buffler,” he said. “I’ll raise ther
country, and I’ll be follerin’ ye with a company of men
’fore another twenty-four hours rolls over my head.”
He stretched forth his hand. “Shake, Buffler; and
you, too, Pawnee! You’re startin’ on a dangerous
trip, and I knows it. Mebbe we mayn’t meet ag’in
ever in this world. But whatever happens, I know
you’ll be found doin’ yer duty.”</p>

<p>He struck his horse with the spurs, waking old Nebuchadnezzar
into renewed life.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” he said. “Good luck to ye, pards!”</p>

<p>And then he rode away&mdash;the wise, simple, and brave
old trapper, Nick Nomad.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PRISONER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lena Forest had hardly entered the cabin and
stepped toward the bed, where, in obedience to the
words of Buffalo Bill, she expected to lie down a while,
when a footstep sounded softly behind her, and a
blanket fell over her head.</p>

<p>Startled and alarmed beyond measure, she yet would
have cried out, but that the blanket was drawn tightly
about her mouth, and on top of the blanket a heavy
hand pressed back the words she would have uttered.
She struggled frantically, but uselessly; for she was
caught up in arms too strong for her to resist, and was
carried quietly out of the room.</p>

<p>Lena soon knew she was out of the cabin, for the
feet of her captor no longer thudded dully on the
wooden floor, but descended, as if down steps, and sank
in soft grass now without a sound.</p>

<p>Then she began to struggle again, trying desperately
to throw off the enveloping and smothering
blanket, and making so gallant a fight for her liberty
that she tore a feather from the redskin’s head. That
feather told her that he was an Indian, which was a
thing she had already guessed and feared.</p>

<p>She tried in vain to scream for help when this awful
fear that she was held by an Indian became certain
knowledge; but again that heavy hand kept her from
making more than a few inarticulate sounds; and she
was being borne on, she knew not where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<p>She became unconscious soon, a result largely of
the choking and smothering blanket, and for a time
thereafter she had no knowledge of anything.</p>

<p>When she was put down at last, arousing at the
same time, she succeeded in whisking aside the blanket.
Then she saw before her a large Indian, almost naked,
smeared with paint, who was drawing a canoe from
beneath the bank, and getting it ready, apparently, for a
journey on the river that flowed before her.</p>

<p>She recognized the river as the cañon stream that
rolled by her home, and she recognized this spot as
one she had seen many a time, a mile below the cabin,
at a point where the walls of the cañon began to contract
on the grassy valley, in readiness for further
narrowing farther down.</p>

<p>The Indian saw that she had recovered consciousness,
and he swung around, lifting his hatchet menacingly.</p>

<p>“White girl no make noise!” he warned, speaking
fair English.</p>

<p>The desire to cry out was frozen in her heart, which
was filled with a strange terror of this painted redskin.
She stared at him, as the bird is said to stare at the
snake in whose power it has fallen.</p>

<p>The savage adjusted the light canoe in the water,
stopping in his work now and then to listen, as if he
anticipated pursuit.</p>

<p>“White girl go with Crazy Snake!” he commanded,
again producing the fear-impelling hatchet, whose
bright blade glanced the sunlight like burnished silver.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
To her imagination that hatchet edge was red with the
blood of her murdered father.</p>

<p>She tried now to spring up, and to run; and she
tried to cry out. But Crazy Snake, with a single
bound, caught her by the hair, and threw her to the
ground. He flashed forth a knife, now, and thrust it
before her terrified eyes.</p>

<p>“Injun kill!” he gurgled, in a way to make her
blood run cold. “White girl want Blackfoot kill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, kill me!” she said, in sudden desperation.
“Nothing better could happen to me now.”</p>

<p>However, he did not put his threat into execution,
for he had simply been trying to frighten her. He
lifted her in his bare, painted arms, and deposited her
in the canoe, she being too helpless from fear and
weakness to do anything to prevent this. Then he
stepped into the canoe himself, pushed it off from
shore, and, seating himself deliberately, he took up
the paddle and sent the light boat skimming downstream.</p>

<p>The current began to race faster here, and this, with
the strokes of the paddle, hurled the canoe on at
dizzying speed. Yet this speed was as nothing compared
with that which the canoe made later on, when it
was caught in the torrent that rushed in wild cataracts
through the pinched-in space of the narrowed
cañon, where the black walls came close together, and
towered to a great height overhead.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake was skillful with the paddle. The girl’s
eyes were fixed on the water ahead, and though more
than once it seemed to her that the frail craft must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
surely be split on some rock, with a deft turn he
guided it past the danger point, and on down the wild
and tumbling stream.</p>

<p>Lena Forest tried to think with something of sanity
of her condition, and failed utterly. Horror still held
her, and she came from under its spell but slowly.</p>

<p>When the rapids had been passed safely, Crazy
Snake began to talk.</p>

<p>“Brown Eyes know why the great Blackfoot chief,
Crazy Snake, do this?” he said, naming her thus from
the color of her eyes.</p>

<p>She stared at him, as if she did not comprehend his
meaning, but really because she was still too terrified
to answer him.</p>

<p>“Blackfeet kill man that dig for the yellow earth,”
he explained. “The yellow earth makes the white
man crazy, and he steals the land of the Indians that
he may dig it. So we kill him.”</p>

<p>She knew that he meant her father.</p>

<p>“White men hunting for the yellow earth threw a
bad spell on the Blackfeet. The evil spirits were made
mad, and killed the Blackfeet. They died. The son
of Crazy Snake died. For that we kill the white men.”</p>

<p>She was sitting in the bow of the canoe, facing him,
and he stared at her with his shining black eyes, that
looked so like the eyes of a snake. She did not wonder
that he was called, or called himself, Crazy Snake;
for those snaky eyes, to her heated imagination, seemed
like the eyes of some deadly serpent. They almost
fascinated her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>“But&mdash;but why do you&mdash;take me?” she gasped at
last.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake gave utterance to what seemed almost
a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Brown Eyes purty squaw!” he said. “Wide Foot,
the squaw of Crazy Snake, is old; he take a young
squaw, who is white. The white men will be killed.
But the Brown Eyes she will live.”</p>

<p>The statement roused her as nothing had done since
the death of her father.</p>

<p>“I would rather die!” she said. “I will kill myself
rather than become your&mdash;your wife!”</p>

<p>She half rose, and in another second would have
leaped into the stream; but he stretched out his long
right arm with a quick motion, catching her by her
hair, which had come unbound in her struggles with
him, and jerked her flat in the bottom of the canoe.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he grunted. “Brown Eyes fool! Brown
Eyes drown herself? No, no! Brown Eyes be the
squaw of Crazy Snake.”</p>

<p>She lay there, in the bottom of the canoe, cowering.</p>

<p>He put the paddle into the canoe, and then lifted
her to a seat, where she sat weakly, regarding him
with looks of terror and loathing.</p>

<p>Then he tried to make her see that he was doing
her a great favor; for he declared again that while
all the white men were to be killed, she was to be permitted
to live, and would become the squaw of a great
chief.</p>

<p>She failed to see the beauty of the picture he tried
to draw. She preferred death to that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>A little farther down the stream Crazy Snake ran
the canoe ashore, where he tied it, after sinking it.</p>

<p>She had been compelled to get out, and sat on the
bank watching him sink and conceal the boat.</p>

<p>“Brown Eyes go on!” he said, coming up to her.</p>

<p>It seemed that her terror could go no further; but
apparently it did, when from the bushes just ahead
there appeared now another Indian.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake showed surprise, thus evidencing that
the appearance of this Indian was unexpected even by
him.</p>

<p>The Indian was a Blackfoot, and was a young man,
whose head displayed the feathers of a chief. For an
Indian, he was decidedly handsome; yet the liberal
application of paint and grease to his body made him a
disgusting sight to the girl prisoner.</p>

<p>His black eyes opened in wide admiration, as he
looked upon her.</p>

<p>“Lightfoot is a long way from the village?” said the
chief, speaking to the younger Indian, who was none
other than the warrior whom the two scouts had observed.</p>

<p>“He was with the party that followed the old trapper,”
said Lightfoot. “We lost his trail and could
not find it again.”</p>

<p>“If the young men wish to find the old whitehead,
they can do it by going up the river.”</p>

<p>Crazy Snake waved his hand in the direction whence
he had come. He led the way under the cover of the
trees, and then turned to the young Indian, who had
followed silently behind the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<p>At the first word it was plain that Crazy Snake had
taken a new line of thought.</p>

<p>“Can the great chief trust his son?” he said, speaking
in the hyperbole characteristic of the red men, for
Lightfoot was not related to him.</p>

<p>Lightfoot folded his arms upon his paint-smeared
bosom and looked Crazy Snake full in the eye.</p>

<p>“The son of the great chief, Crazy Snake, has but
to hear and obey,” he said. “Let the chief speak.
Lightfoot is but a child, and will learn wisdom of
the great chief.”</p>

<p>They spoke in Blackfoot, of which the prisoner did
not understand a word.</p>

<p>She felt so weak and trembling that she was almost
on the point of sinking to the ground. She lifted
her eyes to heaven, as if praying, and uttered a name,
the name of one who, she was sure, would follow to
the ends of the earth, to rescue or avenge her, if he
but knew. And she uttered, also, the name of Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake stopped the words that were on his
tongue and gazed at her in a questioning way.</p>

<p>“What does the Brown Eyes say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” she gasped. “Nothing!”</p>

<p>She shook with terror.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake turned again to Lightfoot.</p>

<p>“The young chief is wise,” he said. “Crazy Snake
is the great war chief of the Blackfeet. His red arrow
burns on the breasts of many white men already,
and its bloody fire shall strike fear everywhere. The
father of Brown Eyes wears it, and his scalp is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in the belt of Running Deer. But the girl is to be kept
in the Blackfoot village. Crazy Snake has work to
do, for the white men will gather to avenge the death
of the men who wear the crimson arrow.”</p>

<p>Lightfoot stood with folded arms, listening.</p>

<p>“White men, one of them Long Hair, are now
pursuing Crazy Snake. So Crazy Snake wishes to
turn back; and he wishes to gather warriors, many
warriors, to oppose the white men. He would strike
the cunning white men down when they follow&mdash;strike
down the thieves that steal the lands of the Blackfeet
that they may dig in it for the yellow earth.”</p>

<p>“The son of the great chief hears,” said Lightfoot,
when the older chief paused.</p>

<p>“The great chief will trust Lightfoot to take the
white prisoner, Brown Eyes, on to the Blackfoot village,
where she is to be held until the coming of Crazy
Snake. Does my son hear with open ears?”</p>

<p>“Lightfoot hears what the great chief says.”</p>

<p>The young Indian looked at the girl, who still stood
trembling before them. A sudden admiration of her
beauty shone in his black eyes, but it was not observed
either by the chief or the girl.</p>

<p>“Lightfoot hears, and will obey,” he repeated.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake returned to the canoe, and seemed to
consider raising it and resuming the voyage down the
river. But he changed his mind, apparently, and, turning
from the river, he hastened away, and was soon
lost to view.</p>

<p>Lightfoot stood looking at the girl who had been
placed in his charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span></p>

<p>“Come!” he said finally. “We go to the village.”</p>

<p>She was listening to the retreating footsteps of the
older chief.</p>

<p>“No, I will not go with you!” she declared.</p>

<p>Admiration showed in his eyes. But he was an Indian,
and accustomed to having women obey. He
caught her by the wrist and jerked her along.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said. “Brown Eyes is very beautiful.
It is too bad that she is to enter the lodge of Crazy
Snake, who has a wife already.” He was speaking
to himself, for his words were Blackfoot, and she did
not understand them. “Brown Eyes is too beautiful
to be the squaw of Crazy Snake. She should mate
with a younger warrior. Is it meet that winter should
marry summer? Brown Eyes is young, and she is
beautiful.”</p>

<p>He stopped and stood facing her, feasting his eyes
on her beauty. There was something in his look that
terrified her. She tried to break away from him, but
again he caught her by the wrist and pulled her along
when she resisted.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said, and this time he spoke in English.
“We go fast. Blackfoot town long, long way.
Crazy Snake say we go fast.”</p>

<span class="fs70">WIND FLOWER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Crazy Snake had told the young chief that pursuit
might be expected, and that was why he was so anxious
to hurry on. He felt sure that soon the dreaded
Long Hair, as Buffalo Bill was called, would be on
his trail. Buffalo Bill’s reputation as a long-distance
shot, as a trailer, and as an enemy whose cunning and
skill were marvelous, was great among the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Because of his fear of pursuit Lightfoot stopped
now and then to listen. Occasionally, where a small
hill invited, he ascended it, dragging the girl with him,
and scanned the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake had disappeared, and even the river
was not now visible, though the black cliff walls of
the cañon could be seen.</p>

<p>Finally the young chief gained the point where he
had left his horse hidden.</p>

<p>Lena Forest was almost exhausted by that time,
through fear and the exertions she had been forced
to put forth. Lightfoot had been merciless in dragging
her on, over obstructions, across chasms and
rocky tracts, and through bushy districts where thorny
shrubs tore her clothing and lacerated her body.</p>

<p>Several times she had dropped down in sheer weakness
and desperation; but at such times he had assumed
the ferocity of the old chief himself, and, drawing his
hatchet, he had threatened her until she had risen and
stumbled on again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>When the little grove was gained where his horse
had been left, Lightfoot was given a shock of surprise.
The horse was gone.</p>

<p>He looked about in fear and anger, his black eyes
searching for footprints of a thief and the hoofmarks
of the horse.</p>

<p>A rippling laugh, strange and wild, came to him
from a little distance.</p>

<p>Lena Forest looked toward the point whence it emanated,
and was astounded to see an Indian girl rise
there from behind a rock and come forward. The
girl seemed amused when first she appeared; but a
frown was on her brown face as she approached the
girl prisoner and the young chief.</p>

<p>“The Wind Flower!” gasped the young chief,
speaking below his breath. “What does she here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mighty chief,” she said in mockery, “where is
thy horse? I see it not. The eagles must have carried
it away!”</p>

<p>He regarded her uneasily. “Wind Flower has taken
it,” he said. “Where has she placed it? And what
does she here?”</p>

<p>The Indian girl laughed again, a rippling laugh that
had in it something of the music of running water, for
it seemed to bubble and gurgle in her brown throat.
Yet that suspicious and questioning light remained in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“I found the horse of the great chief, Lightfoot! I
am but a squaw&mdash;not a mighty warrior and hunter.
But I could have taken his horse and ridden it far
from here, if I had willed. The mighty young chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
is like the bear that sleeps when the winter winds blow;
he does not see, and he does not hear. An enemy
might have taken his scalp, as well as his horse.”</p>

<p>He shifted nervously on his feet under this rebuke,
and looked at her furtively as she turned to Lena
Forest, throwing out one brown hand in a significant
gesture.</p>

<p>“Where is the young chief taking the white
woman?” she asked, and at the question jealousy
flashed in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>Lena Forest understood this language of the eyes,
even though she could not understand the words. Jealousy
is the same, and expresses itself much the same
way; whether it burns in the heart of a white woman
or of an Indian maid. She saw that this Indian girl
loved Lightfoot, and guessed that she was probably
his promised wife. The discovery, if it was a discovery,
gave her hope.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands to the Indian girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell him to let me go!” she begged, in pitiful
tones. “You are a woman and can sympathize with
me. Ask him to let me go!”</p>

<p>Wind Flower looked at her curiously, while a red
flush crept into her brown cheeks, giving them an
added beauty.</p>

<p>“Why white girl here?” she said, speaking English
with difficulty, and giving the words a queer pronunciation.
“Why white girl with Lightfoot?”</p>

<p>Lightfoot himself answered her.</p>

<p>“It is at the order of the great chief, Crazy Snake,”
he explained. “The white girl is the prisoner of Crazy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Snake. He took her from her cabin, after the Blackfeet
had killed her father, and he has ordered me to
take her on to the Blackfoot village. She is to become
the white squaw of the great chief, Crazy Snake.”</p>

<p>Wind Flower looked at him so sharply that it
seemed the fire of her black eyes burned into his very
soul.</p>

<p>“Does the young chief speak with the forked tongue
of the serpent?” she demanded. “Does he not love
the white girl, and does he not take her for himself?”</p>

<p>Lightfoot protested that this was not true, and repeated
his assertion that he was but obeying the orders
of Crazy Snake.</p>

<p>“Wind Flower has concealed my horse in the glen
beyond?” he asked, finding that his protestations were
not without effect.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was stolen and is now far away!”</p>

<p>“I know it is in the glen beyond.”</p>

<p>He walked on into the glen, and there found not
only his own horse, but the one which the Indian girl
had ridden. When he returned he brought both with
him.</p>

<p>Wind Flower sat on a stone, regarding the white
girl distrustfully, while the latter was appealing to
her with a multiplicity of words and gestures.</p>

<p>“We will go on together,” said Lightfoot, speaking
to the Indian girl. “Why is Wind Flower here, so
far from the village?”</p>

<p>“The chief sees the bow and the arrows on my
horse,” she answered. “I hunted the deer, and he
came in this direction, so that I followed. Then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
found the horse of the young chief, and from the top
of the hill I saw the young chief and his prisoner.”</p>

<p>“We will go on together,” he repeated.</p>

<p>He turned his horse about and commanded Lena
Forest to mount to its back. Then he walked beside
the horse, leading it, while the Indian girl, assisting
herself to the back of her own animal, rode at his side.</p>

<p>Lena Forest was buoyed somewhat with hope, since
meeting this Indian girl; she believed that one of her
own sex, even though an Indian, would be less heartless
than a Blackfoot warrior.</p>

<p>The horses did not go fast enough to suit Lightfoot,
and he dropped behind, and lashed them on with
switches, running at their heels.</p>

<p>He still was not traveling as rapidly as he desired.
Fear of Long Hair lay heavily on him.</p>

<p>“Will Wind Flower stay here with the white girl
prisoner of Crazy Snake, while Lightfoot goes to the
top of the hill?” he asked at length. He gave it as
an order, though wording it as a question; and then
began to climb the hill, leaving the two girls there on
the horses. In a few moments he had disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>Again, with pleading words, the white girl began
to beg for the assistance of the Indian.</p>

<p>A strange look was in the face of the Indian maid,
and Lena Forest believed it denoted a yielding, and so
her hopes rose swiftly.</p>

<p>Wind Flower drew nearer, forcing her horse close
up against that ridden by the prisoner. She stared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
with her black eyes into the brown orbs of the prisoner.</p>

<p>“The paleface loves the young chief?” she said,
her voice tremulous. The words were articulated
queerly, but their meaning was plain.</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” stammered Lena Forest. “That is a
mistake. I do not love him&mdash;I am afraid of him. I
want to go to the white people&mdash;my people. We can
go now. We have the horses, and he is afoot. Let
us go now. You are a woman. Help another woman
who is in trouble.”</p>

<p>The black eyes looking into hers burned with a dangerous
fire.</p>

<p>“The white girl lies!” said Wind Flower.</p>

<p>“No, no! My father was killed, and I am a prisoner.
Let me go; help me to get away.”</p>

<p>“Would the white girl go to the white people?”</p>

<p>“I swear it! Oh, I swear it! Help me to get away.
Perhaps I can pay you in some way! Perhaps I
can&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The white girl’s tongue is crooked as the tongue of
the mother of all serpents! She loves the young chief.
She would take him from Wind Flower. And for
that she dies!”</p>

<p>She drew a knife and struck with sudden fury at
the breast of the swaying girl before her. But her
horse chanced to shift its position, and her blow fell
short.</p>

<p>Lena Forest screamed in fear, and began to belabor
her horse, urging it on.</p>

<p>As her horse jumped into motion, the wild thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
that perhaps she could now escape came to her; and
she beat the horse with her hands and kicked his side
with her heels. He started into a quick jogtrot.</p>

<p>The Indian girl rode after her, and again tried to
get near enough to strike with the knife. As she
did so the bushes parted, and Lightfoot came bounding
upon the scene.</p>

<p>He shouted at the furiously jealous Indian girl in
anger, and, with quick bounds, caught the horse ridden
by Lena Forest, throwing it back, with a heavy
jerk on the bridle.</p>

<p>“Does Wind Flower love death?” he demanded of
the Indian girl, facing her now, while holding the
bridle of the horse ridden by the prisoner. “The
vengeance of Crazy Snake is keen as his scalping knife.
He will strike Wind Flower to the earth, if he knows
of this. What does my little sister mean by it?”</p>

<p>The anger seemed to die out of the face of the Indian
girl, to be replaced by a look of fear.</p>

<p>“The rough wind of the mountain blew on the head
of Wind Flower, and it made her wild,” she said.
“But the wind has passed, and she is well again.”</p>

<p>He shot her a keen glance.</p>

<p>“Be careful that the mountain wind does not strike
the head of Wind Flower again,” he warned; “it
might take it off, and roll it down the hillside!”</p>

<p>He glanced back along the trail, and then at the
half-fainting white girl. He drew his hatchet and
waved it in her face.</p>

<p>“We go on!” he said. “But the mountain wind
still blows!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span></p>

<p>Then he again got behind the horses and drove them
on with switches, getting increased speed out of them.</p>

<p>The brown face of Wind Flower had assumed a
dark, leaden hue, as wild emotions raged and burned
in her heart.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FLIGHT OF THE FUGITIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>That he might hasten along faster, and at the same
time conceal his trail in the tracks made by horses that
had passed, the crafty young chief soon left the rough
and rocky hillsides, and entered the regular mountain
highway that connected the town below with some of
the mines above.</p>

<p>This was the trail which Lena Forest used in making
her infrequent visits to the town. And when she
saw it, and knew that her captor was intending to enter
it, her hopes rose again, and gave her renewed strength.</p>

<p>Lightfoot was shrewd enough to know that since
the Indian scare there was not much likelihood that
any wayfarers would be encountered on that trail.
What he feared were the men whom he believed to
be following him&mdash;Buffalo Bill and his comrades, of
whom Crazy Snake had told him, and against whom
he had been warned.</p>

<p>Lightfoot was light of foot, as his name indicated;
in truth, he was a copper-colored Mercury, so fleet of
foot and untiring was he. Fast as he could drive the
horses on, he had no trouble in keeping at their heels.</p>

<p>He drove them down the trail, which here curved
and wound round and over the hills, dipping and rising
and losing itself in many a charming spot.</p>

<p>Lena Forest looked hungrily ahead, whenever a
rise of the trail gave her an extended view, always
hoping to see there white horsemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>At first this crafty maneuver of Lightfoot’s puzzled
her, for he seemed to be going toward the town, when
she naturally anticipated that he would wish to keep
as far from it as possible. But soon she began to understand,
when she saw, by glancing back, that the
hoofprints of the horses and his own moccasin tracks
were lost in the other tracks, which, in such numbers,
had beaten the ground hard as flint.</p>

<p>She saw, too, that it was probably his purpose to
leave this main trail at some point, after utilizing it
all he could, and that he would then strike again into
the rocky hills, and hold his course toward the Blackfoot
village.</p>

<p>The white girl and the Indian maid talked little as
the horses were thus driven on. Lena Forest had
about lost hope of being able to persuade this Indian
girl to help her; and she thought it not wise, anyway,
to express her desires when Lightfoot could hear, for
he had shown a pretty clear understanding of English.</p>

<p>Though the Blackfeet were now threatening a
bloody war on the whites, there had been in the recent
past so much intercourse and trading between the two
races that most of the Blackfeet, men and women, had
picked up a fair smattering of the language of the
white men, so that they could understand it at least in
its simpler forms.</p>

<p>By and by the fear of the pursuers he believed to be
following became so strong in the mind of the young
Indian chief that once more he left his prisoner in
charge of the Indian girl, and stole away for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
of climbing a hill, that he might look backward
over the way he had come.</p>

<p>The place selected for leaving the horses and the
prisoner was a dark hollow, where the trail made a
quick bend round rocks, and where bushes, growing
in each side of the trail, made good cover.</p>

<p>Those bushes shut him from sight of the prisoner
and the Indian girl almost as soon as he started on
his way.</p>

<p>Lena Forest was about to begin her petitions again,
and was trying to summon enough courage to try to
make an escape if there was another refusal, when
the bushes near by rustled, and a young man stood
forth, leveling a revolver at Wind Flower.</p>

<p>“Don’t move!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The face of the girl prisoner became white as chalk
when she saw him, and she seemed about to slide in a
faint from her horse; but she maintained her balance,
and whispered:</p>

<p>“Bruce! Oh, save me, dear!”</p>

<p>The Indian girl became rigid as stone from fear;
her black eyes opening in fright when she looked into
the muzzle of that revolver. Her lips trembled and
opened, as if she meant to call for help.</p>

<p>“Don’t move!” came the command again.</p>

<p>The young white man, dressed in miner’s clothing,
stepped out quickly.</p>

<p>“Down from the horse!” he said, his voice low but
commanding.</p>

<p>The words were addressed to the Indian girl; and,
backed by the revolver, it seemed that she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
not dare to disobey them. Yet as she slid to the
ground, she screamed aloud for help, and threw her
arms round the neck of the young white man, surprising
and handicapping him.</p>

<p>That scream, and the fact that her lover, Bruce Clayton,
was there to help her, and needed help now himself,
aroused the dormant energy of Lena Forest.</p>

<p>She caught the rein of her horse and jerked the
animal toward the combatants&mdash;for at the moment
the white man and the Indian girl were struggling in
lively conflict&mdash;and then she tried to get down and
go to the youth’s assistance.</p>

<p>The horse gave a jump, being frightened, and she
fell to the ground. This scared the other horse. He,
too, gave a rearing plunge, and went clattering down
the trail, and out of sight beyond the fringing bushes.</p>

<p>“Let him go!” Lena Forest panted, as she dashed
at the Indian girl.</p>

<p>But Clayton had caught hold of the Indian girl, and
now he threw her from him. She staggered, and then
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Clayton caught the half-fainting white girl in his
arms, and in another moment he was running with
her along the trail, following the course taken by the
scared horses.</p>

<p>On the hillside sounded a whoop, showing that
Lightfoot had heard the outcry, suspected something
of the character of what was happening, and was
bounding down the hill.</p>

<p>Clayton had a horse below, at the side of the trail,
concealed in a small grove; and for that grove he now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
made lively tracks. He reached the horse, and threw
his sweetheart into the saddle; then he sprang up himself,
mounting with surprising speed and agility.
Catching her close in his arms again, he drove the
horse into the trail, and sped on.</p>

<p>Behind him he heard another whoop&mdash;an Indian
war whoop now, telling him that the enraged redskin
was pursuing, or, at least, that he would pursue instantly.</p>

<p>Clayton lashed the horse; and, in spite of its double
burden, it fairly flew along the winding trail.</p>

<p>“We’re all right!” he said to the girl he clasped in
his arms. “I don’t understand it, but you’re safe now,
Lena; and I think God must have sent me along the
trail at just that time, that I might save you from
that wretch.”</p>

<p>She shuddered, put her arms round his shoulders,
and nestled closer to him.</p>

<p>It seemed a delightful dream&mdash;this sudden transition
from her position as the prisoner of a painted Indian
into the arms of the youth she loved, and whom
she had promised to marry.</p>

<p>“You’re all right now?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered; “only&mdash;only terribly frightened!”</p>

<p>“Still frightened? You’re safe now as can be.”</p>

<p>“I mean that I&mdash;I was frightened and I’m so weak
that I don’t think I could walk; but this is heaven,
after that&mdash;after I thought I was to be taken to the
Blackfoot village, and there forced to become the
squaw of an Indian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<p>“That young Indian chief?”</p>

<p>“No; Crazy Snake!”</p>

<p>“The infernal villain! He was with that young
chief? I didn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“But he captured me&mdash;slipped on me in the house,
after father was killed, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your father dead?” He was shocked at the sad
news.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!” She sobbed again. “He was
killed by the Blackfeet, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She choked and could not go on.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” he urged.</p>

<p>She told him, brokenly, and in as few words as she
could.</p>

<p>He was silent a while, his eyes fixed on the trail,
and his hearing strained backward in anticipation of
pursuit.</p>

<p>“I knew the Blackfeet were rising, and I heard you
had been in town,” he said. “So I thought I’d ride
out, and have a talk with you and your father; for I
thought it wasn’t any longer safe for you to stay out
in that lonely place.</p>

<p>“That’s how I happened to meet you on the trail.
I saw the Indian coming, driving the two horses; but,
truly, I didn’t know then one of the persons riding
was you.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what to expect of the Indian; so I
hid my horse in the grove, and went into concealment
myself at the bend in the trail; for I didn’t know but
I might be needed, seeing that the riders of the horses
seemed to be women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p>“When I saw that you were one of them, I was too
astonished for anything. And then the Indian went
up the hill; and&mdash;&mdash;Well, you know the rest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are so brave!” she said.</p>

<p>“Not I. You see, anybody would have done that;
and when I saw that it was you, I’d have died there
fighting that rascal to get you away from him.”</p>

<p>“If he gets those horses, he’ll follow us,” she said,
glancing back along the trail.</p>

<p>“He’ll follow, anyway, I think, horses or no horses;
and some of those Indians can run like antelopes. The
trouble is, he’s likely to get help.”</p>

<p>“He is a good runner.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t insult nor abuse you?”</p>

<p>“No; but I was dreadfully afraid of him. The girl
was jealous of me.”</p>

<p>“Jealous?”</p>

<p>“The young chief is her lover, I think; and she
fancied he was taking me to his wigwam.”</p>

<p>He laughed then.</p>

<p>“It was no laughing matter,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, of course not; very far from it. But it’s amusing
to think she could be jealous of you.” He drew
rein suddenly. “Hello! There are Indians down below.
Blackfeet, too, and they’re coming this way; but
I don’t think they’ve seen us. We’ve got to leave the
trail and get into the hills here.”</p>

<p>He looked for rocky ground, and drew the horse
out upon it.</p>

<p>The knowledge that another peril confronted her
served to make Lena Forest more courageous. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
released herself from her lover’s arms, and sat upright,
shifting to a position behind him, where she would
less hamper his movements. He chose rocky ground
for the horse, and went on as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“We’ll be all right until these Blackfeet meet that
young chief. And then they’ll learn about us, and,
of course, will follow us at once.”</p>

<p>“They’re mounted, too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, on Indian ponies; and those ponies are better
able to climb about these rocky hills than this big
horse is. We must get as big a start of them as we
can.”</p>

<p>He drove the horse on without mercy, forcing it at
a swift pace over the rough country, trying all the
time to pick ground that would leave a poor trail.</p>

<p>As they thus rode on they heard the wild war
whoops that announced either their discovery, or that
the Indians had encountered the young chief, Lightfoot,
and learned from him what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Now, we must ride&mdash;ride!” said Clayton, and he
bent forward in the saddle, lashing the horse on, and
using the spurs mercilessly.</p>

<p>Again the wild yells of the Blackfeet broke forth.</p>

<p>“They may be yelling for some other reason,” she
said, trying to encourage her lover.</p>

<p>“Yes; they may have sighted Cody and Pawnee
Bill,” he assented. “There’s no telling; but they’ve
struck something, some trail or some enemy, and, like
a pack of hounds when the game is scented, they can’t
help yelping.”</p>

<p>The path grew rougher, if that can be called a path<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
which was more than half the time but a broken game
trail, that played out and began again in the most eccentric
manner. They had gained a high shoulder of
the hills, and below them lay open country, that
stretched on into illimitable distances, where there was
much coarse grass.</p>

<p>“There is one way of defeating those scoundrels&mdash;of
keeping them from seeing our trail,” said Clayton,
at last; “and that is to burn it.”</p>

<p>“Burn it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; ride down into that, and fire the grass, and
then make our flight behind the fire and the smoke.”</p>

<p>“And have the fire overtake us and burn us to death!
But try it; I’d rather be burned to death than to fall
into the hands of those awful and merciless Blackfeet.”</p>

<p>He guided the horse down the slope and on toward
the grassy levels that lay beyond. Ten minutes later
he was well out in the grass.</p>

<p>Here he stooped from the saddle, pulled a handful
of dry grass, to which he applied a lighted match, and
then threw it down.</p>

<p>While he did this the horse stood panting, sweat
dripping from it.</p>

<p>Young Clayton had seen that he must do something
desperate, if he escaped the Blackfeet; and this was
the thing he was now to try.</p>

<p>The burning grass communicated fire to that surrounding
the horse. Clayton sent the animal on, and
with a few leaps it left the conflagration behind it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>The remarkable manner in which the fire spread
through the dry grass was worthy of comment. It
flamed up with a roar. Seeming to create a wind from
the rising currents of heated air, the fire began to run
before the breeze, leaping along in an amazing way.</p>

<p>It spread round from the spot where it had been
started, burning backward toward the hills and outward
in the direction taken by the horse.</p>

<p>“Now, for a race!” thought Clayton, struck by a
sudden fear, as he saw how fast the fire was spreading.
“Maybe that will be worse to get away from
than the Blackfeet; and if anything should happen
to the horse we’ll have to run for our lives!”</p>

<p>He voiced none of this to the girl.</p>

<p>“The Blackfeet haven’t been sighted yet,” he said
to her. “They’ll know, of course, or guess, that we’ve
taken to the grass, and set it on fire; but after that
black smoke gets to rolling and the fire to running
good, it will be hard for them to tell where we have
gone, and I defy them to follow our trail after the fire
has burned the grass.”</p>

<p>Before he had ridden a mile the fire was flaming
in high billows behind him, and the smoke, black and
thick, filled the sky.</p>

<p>Clayton began to be somewhat alarmed.</p>

<p>In desperation he had entered this grassy land and
had fired the grass, but he seemed not to have bettered
his position, in spite of the blaze. Indeed, if the fire
ringed him in, or overtook him, his situation would
be worse than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span></p>

<p>Though his face paled, he spoke hopefully to the
girl who clung to him.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet were still unseen; and, indeed could
hardly have been seen now through the pall of smoke
and the billowing flame, even if they had come riding
straight down from the hills in chase.</p>

<p>The horse was a gallant animal, and was standing
up splendidly to the work, yet the strain was beginning
to tell. Its sides were heaving, its head was sunk low,
and its whole body was covered with a white lather of
sweat. Its nostrils gaped wide and red as it plunged
onward.</p>

<p>If the horse had been fresh, the hopes of Bruce Clayton
would have mounted high, for its gait was faster
than the running advance of the fire; but the horse was
becoming exhausted. It had been tired even before
he encountered the young Indian chief, and since then
he had driven it hard.</p>

<p>Three miles away, and lying along the rocky rim
of the cañon which held the river, was a long strip of
woodland.</p>

<p>On the other side were the hills.</p>

<p>The open, grassy country lay straight ahead between
these two.</p>

<p>The speed of the fire, as it now pursued him, admonished
Clayton that safety demanded he should not
hold to the straight-ahead line. The fire would run
on indefinitely, but the horse could not do so. The
Indians were in the hills when last he heard them;
and for that reason chiefly he turned the horse toward
the distant fringe of timber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>“We can make those trees without trouble, I think,”
he said, encouraging the girl, whose terrified backward
glances he had observed.</p>

<p>“But the fire is coming very fast!” she said.</p>

<p>“And we are riding fast!”</p>

<p>“But it is gaining on us. The horse has lost speed
in the last mile. The poor thing is exhausted.”</p>

<p>“Still, I think we can reach those trees. We’ve got
to do that.”</p>

<p>The horse stumbled, bringing a cry from the girl;
but righted, and galloped heavily on. Soon it stumbled
again.</p>

<p>Then before them they beheld a yawning rent in
the earth, like a large and deep ditch. It was in fact
a dry waterway, cut by rains that came in some torrential
storm down from the hills. It was impossible
to go round this gap in the earth.</p>

<p>Driven by spur, whip, and voice, the tired horse
tried to leap it. It rose in the air, making a gallant
effort, but lacked strength to carry it across, and went
falling down, down, into the great gully.</p>

<p>Lena Forest screamed as the horse took that plunge.</p>

<p>Clayton gripped tightly the rein, caught hold of
the horn of the saddle, yelled for the girl to cling to
him, and steadied himself for the shock of the fall.</p>

<p>The horse struck with stunning force, and rolled
over, throwing the girl to one side.</p>

<p>Clayton was hurled from the saddle over the horse’s
head, where he lay, unconscious and white-faced.</p>

<p>Lena Forest scrambled up unhurt, but dazed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
frightened. Then she screamed again, as she saw
Bruce lying there as if he were dead.</p>

<p>And on came the fire, roaring and writhing, shooting
up crackling flames that seemed to laugh in glee,
as if they realized the terrible predicament of the girl
and her brave lover.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE SCOUTS’ PURSUIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill, or Kulux-Kittibux,
as he was known among the Indians, after the departure
of Nick Nomad, began a search along the
cañon stream. They left their horses behind them, for
the ground was too rough for a horse to get over it.</p>

<p>The thing for which the eagle eyes of the scout
were searching was seen by him at last, when he began
to despair of finding anything of the kind.</p>

<p>“There it is, Gordon,” he said, pointing.</p>

<p>What seemed a foot section of twisted vine rose
from the water, and was wound in the most natural
manner round the root of a tree.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill scrambled toward it, and soon had his
hand on it.</p>

<p>“Yes, just as I thought,” he said, and he began to
pull on the thing.</p>

<p>Soon it lengthened, and a sunken canoe rose into
view. It had been sunk cleverly there by its Indian
owner; and the painter of time-stained rawhide,
twisted round the root in imitation of a vine, the Indian
had felt sure could not be distinguished from an
actual vine.</p>

<p>The canoe was drawn from the water, and the water
poured out of it. Then the two friends entered it.
Buffalo Bill took up the paddle that had been lashed
to the canoe, and turned the bow down the stream.</p>

<p>They ran the rapids successfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<p>Because of the speed with which the current hurried
them on, and also because of the cleverness of Crazy
Snake, they did not see where he had concealed and
sunk the canoe in which he had gone down the stream;
but swept on past it, and soon again were in rapids
that bore them farther and farther from that spot.</p>

<p>Finally they abandoned the canoe, after sinking it
and marking the place, and went along the banks of
the cañon stream, trying to find the trail of Crazy
Snake.</p>

<p>“He’s been too much for us,” the scout admitted,
when, after long searching on either shore, and for
a long distance up and down the river, they were still
in the dark. “The rascal was Crazy Snake, I don’t
doubt; and he’s one of the cleverest and least crazy
of all the Blackfeet.”</p>

<p>As they continued this search, they saw black smoke
roll up from the wide stretch of low grassland that
fell away from the foot of the hills.</p>

<p>Trees and hills intervened to keep them from at
once seeing the fire which gave birth to the smoke.</p>

<p>When they climbed a hill, and the scout leveled on
the grassland his field glasses, the smoke and fire had
attained such volume that the fugitives riding away
before the flames were not visible to him.</p>

<p>Nor could he and Pawnee Bill detect any Indians
out there, or in the hills adjacent.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of it, Cody?” Pawnee Bill
asked.</p>

<p>The scout could not tell him. There were many
ways in which such a fire might have started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>The thing was so suggestive, however, that the
scouts hung about the edge of the grassland, close
down by the river, a long time, looking for Blackfeet
along the slopes of the hills.</p>

<p>At length they were astonished by seeing a young
man come staggering out of the cañon and running
toward them.</p>

<p>He had seen them, and was trying to reach them.
As he drew nearer, they saw that his face and hands
were blackened, as if by fire or smoke; and he not
only staggered, but fell, as he came on.</p>

<p>“Blackfoot deviltry, I reckon!” said Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>They ran to meet the young man.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill now recognized him as the thoroughly
reformed youth he had met in the town the day before,
and with whom he had talked on the subject of a probable
Blackfoot uprising.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Clayton,” he said. “Pool Clayton. He’s
hurt, I think.”</p>

<p>Clayton was gasping from the effects of his violent
run. As soon as he reached them he began to tell his
story, and it amazed them:</p>

<p>“The girl whose father you were burying,” he said;
“the girl who was carried away by Crazy Snake from
the cabin, she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped, choking for breath.</p>

<p>“Yes; go on!” the scout begged.</p>

<p>“I found her in charge of a young Indian called
Lightfoot, who had an Indian girl with him; and
I took her away from them. They followed us, and
other Blackfeet chased us. We took to the grass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
country, which I fired, thinking thus to hide the trail
of my horse. We were both riding one horse. But
the horse was weakened by the long run from the fire,
and finally fell into a deep gully, in trying to leap it.</p>

<p>“I struck on my head, and didn’t know anything for
a while. When I came to myself the girl was gone. I
couldn’t find any trail, or anything; and I don’t know
what became of her, or what to make of it. The girl
was Lena Forest, and she said you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped again, coughing and out of breath, but
he had told enough to stir them into the most intense
interest.</p>

<p>“Guide us to that gully,” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>They started at once, Clayton, telling more of his
story as they hurried on.</p>

<p>His smoky, grimy appearance was caused by the
fact that in reaching them he had passed through a
portion of the burned area.</p>

<p>He conducted them as quickly as possible down the
cañon, and then out into the burned grassland, to the
spot where his horse had tried to leap the deep gully,
and had fallen into it.</p>

<p>The horse was found there, dead, for in its fall it
had received injuries which killed it.</p>

<p>Clayton and the scouts, in gaining this spot, followed
the gully from the cañon, thus remaining below
the level of the grassland; a fact they counted on to
keep them out of sight of any Blackfeet in the hills.</p>

<p>The young man showed them where he had fallen,
and where he had searched, after his return to consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>They took up the work where he had dropped it,
giving to it their great skill.</p>

<p>There were no tracks visible at first in the burned
grass; but when they had gone up the gully some distance
they found an Indian trail. Two pairs of moccasins
had come down from the hills to that point,
where they had entered the gully.</p>

<p>As they had not climbed out of the gully on the
other side, it was certain they had either gone back, or
up or down it.</p>

<p>They had not gone back, and the scouts began to
search the gully closely.</p>

<p>Then they found faint traces of the moccasin tracks
on the hard soil, with the toes pointing down the gully.</p>

<p>Following this faint trail, they discovered that the
Indians had reached the point where now lay the dead
horse.</p>

<p>The rest was plain. They had captured the girl and
taken her on with them; and, being in a hurry, through
fear, perhaps, they had not stopped to scalp the young
white man who lay there unconscious, and whom no
doubt they thought dead.</p>

<p>“They went with her to the cañon,” was the declaration
of Buffalo Bill, when he had spelled this out from
the dim writing in the soil of the gully.</p>

<p>They hastened on to the cañon, and soon reached it.</p>

<p>The stream roared and raced before them.</p>

<p>On the opposite side was a high, unscalable wall,
showing conclusively that the Indians and their prisoner
had not gone that way.</p>

<p>“Gone downstream,” said Buffalo Bill; “and, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
course, they went in a canoe, for they couldn’t have
done otherwise.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do now but to retrace their
way to where the scouts had sunk the Indian canoe,
raise it, and set out down the river, following the blind
water trail taken by the Indians and their captive.</p>

<p>The mental state of young Clayton may be imagined
while this search was being made, and now when this
canoe pursuit was begun. Yet he tried to be hopeful,
and he was resolutely courageous.</p>

<p>He crouched in the stern of the canoe, wishing that
he had in his own hands the stout ash blade which
the scout was wielding so skillfully in the bow. He
felt that the speed of the canoe was slow, very slow,
though it was going as fast as the nature of the channel
warranted.</p>

<p>Rocks jutted up in the stream here and there, and
at sharp bends the rocks at the sides threatened the
canoe as it swung round them.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill gave his sole attention to the stream and
to the paddle.</p>

<p>The other scout kept his keen eyes busy in searching
the walls and the shores and the stream ahead, lest
the canoe should be run into an ambush.</p>

<p>Soon the speed of the canoe ought to have satisfied
even the wild anxiety of the young lover. The current
had quickened again into cataracts that tossed
and hurled the little craft about as if it were but an
eggshell. The rate at which it flew on was enough
to take the breath of the canoemen.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill poised and dipped his paddle with rare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
skill. It needed a good eye, a strong arm, and a steady
brain, and he had all three.</p>

<p>A rock reared itself in the center of the stream, and
the current threw the canoe at it, as if to split it in
two; but the unerring paddle swept the canoe to one
side, and the dangerous rock shot past, with the water
boiling white round and over it. A swift turn of the
channel threw the canoe over against the wall of dark
granite, as if to smash it there; but again the paddle
urged it back into the middle of the boiling water, and
held it there, as it sped on with arrowy swiftness.</p>

<p>The cañon walls came closer together, pinching in,
confining the water, and increasing the strength of the
current. The waterway grew dark, as if enveloped in
twilight; yet the white water swirling and boiling over
and round sharp, up-thrust rocks could still be seen,
wherever the rocks lifted themselves like hungry teeth.
Around these, dipping and paddling lustily, the scout
guided the dancing canoe.</p>

<p>Clayton was hanging on as if for dear life, for now
and then the canoe rose into the air and gave a leap
as it took some cataract and shot on, the waters roaring
about the canoe in a fearful din.</p>

<p>At last the cañon opened, brightening ahead; and
soon the worst of the perilous way was past, with
smoother water opening before them.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill watched keenly for some indications
on the shore that would show that the captors of the
girl had left the river with her here.</p>

<p>The boat moved on more slowly, to enable him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
do this; but no signs of such a disembarkation were to
be seen.</p>

<p>Soon before the canoe loomed the darkness of another
narrow reach of the cañon.</p>

<p>“Shall we go into it?” the scout shouted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pawnee Bill. “They haven’t landed
here; so they must have gone on.”</p>

<p>The canoe shot, with dizzying swiftness, toward the
dark opening, the current again running beneath the
keel with race-horse speed, requiring, for the safe
management of the canoe, all of Buffalo Bill’s marvelous
skill with the paddle.</p>

<p>It was seen, when they were fairly in the dark opening,
that here the cañon roofed itself overhead; so
that the river ran through a black tunnel, making thus
practically an underground river.</p>

<p>Neither of the three men had ever been on this part
of the river before; but Clayton recalled what some
of his former associates, the outlaws, had told him
of an “underground river,” called the Bitter Water,
that cut through a cañon in these mountains. He knew
now that he was afloat on that underground stream.</p>

<p>What the result would be he could not foretell. But
he recked not of the danger. If Lena Forest had been
taken through it, he would not hesitate to follow; no,
not even if it led him to death.</p>

<p>“Hold hard!” Buffalo Bill shouted, for the canoe
was jumping and bucking like a wild horse. “Hold
hard!”</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill could not use his eyes to much advantage
in a search of the black walls; and as for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the young man, he had all he wanted to do to cling to
his place as the canoe flew on.</p>

<p>The darkness became like ink, showing that the
river was here completely walled in; and it seemed
to him that the water grew rougher, while certainly
its roar was much louder, due to its closed-in condition.
The roar was thunderous now.</p>

<p>But on the canoe went, through the darkness and
the howling noise, whether to destruction, or to be
guided through to safety, Bruce Clayton could not tell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="fs70">AGAIN A PRISONER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lena Forest had been recaptured by the handsome
young chief, Lightfoot. By hard riding, he and a
comrade had circled round the eastern end of the line
of fire, only to find their horses exhausted by the terrible
run and themselves driven back by the flames.</p>

<p>They abandoned their horses, and when the fire died
down along the edge of the rocky hills, they set out
across the burned area on foot.</p>

<p>They had become separated from the other Blackfeet,
also, in the wild chase. Lightfoot had lost sight
of the young Indian girl, Wind Flower.</p>

<p>His present companion was a young brave who
stood ready to yield him obedience as a chieftain of
the Blackfoot nation. With this young warrior, whose
name was Red Antelope, Lightfoot came finally to the
gully.</p>

<p>They could not leap it because of its width, and this
fact induced the young chief to think that perhaps the
horse of the white man had not been able to get across.</p>

<p>To break their trail, Lightfoot descended, with his
companion, into the gully; and then they went on
down, until they reached the point where Clayton’s
horse had fallen.</p>

<p>They saw the girl bending over the prostrate youth,
and the horse lying dead. She did not see them, so
wrapped was she in her grief and in her frantic efforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
to restore life to the seemingly inanimate form
of her hero.</p>

<p>Under the conditions, they had no trouble in approaching
her and making her again a prisoner.</p>

<p>Lightfoot was on the point of lifting the scalp of
the apparently dead white man, when a sound off in
the distance made him think that enemies were near
and haste was desirable; so he caught up the girl, and,
with the aid of Red Antelope, bore her hastily toward
the cañon. There they brought to light a sunken canoe,
which they emptied of its water, and set out down the
cañon stream in it, taking the helpless and almost insane
white girl with them.</p>

<p>Of the running of the cañon river, Lena Forest had
afterward no very clear recollection. That recollection
was like the memory of a hideous nightmare.
The flying canoe, the water that boiled round the sharp
rocks, the black shadows and the blacker cañon tunnel,
together with the painted faces and half-naked
bodies of her Blackfeet captors, were things and shapes
of terror from which she shrank in fright, cowering,
and covering her eyes.</p>

<p>Her strength and the temporary heroism she had
shown when with her lover had gone. She felt that
death was better than this; and once, in her despair,
she would have thrown herself into the river, if Red
Antelope had not restrained her. He threw her down
in the bottom of the canoe, with a cry of warning and
anger, and then swung his hatchet menacingly before
her terrified eyes.</p>

<p>Lightfoot, wielding the paddle, grunted assent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
this threat. In his eyes, a squaw should be made obedient,
and fear and threats were good weapons for that
purpose. If an Indian squaw was disobedient to her
lord and master, she was flogged; and he, without compunction,
would have applied a whip to this white girl,
if he had thought it necessary. Women were wholly
inferior creatures, and they might be stolen as a horse
is stolen; and if so stolen, they belonged by right to
the one who thus carried them away. It was Indian
custom, and to the Indian mind that made it right.</p>

<p>So they gave scant attention to the tears and entreaties
and the pitiful terror of the white girl thus
dragged into a horrible captivity. Tears did not kill
women. In their opinion, tears and crying were good
for them; they often made the eyes brighter and
washed the dust of the prairie from smooth brown
cheeks!</p>

<p>After the passage of the underground river, the
canoe shot out into comparatively placid water, with
green banks on each side, between which it floated,
until soon Blackfeet horsemen were seen, off on the
right bank. These horsemen brandished lances and
yelled as they came riding wildly toward the canoe.</p>

<p>Lightfoot stood up, waving his paddle, and then
his hand.</p>

<p>He was immediately recognized. With a thunder
of hoofs, and more yelling, the wild horsemen drew
up on the bank as the canoe was shot to land.</p>

<p>Lena Forest, white-faced and fearful, regarded this
array of naked warriors with dismay. But her heart
was already broken, because of her belief that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
lover was dead. If these Indians would only kill her,
she would not object, she thought. She feared captivity
and Indian cruelty more than she feared death.</p>

<p>The horsemen were a part of Crazy Snake’s band.
As for that chief, he was absent, and was said to be
gone to get more warriors, with whom to resist the
white men in the fight that all believed would now
surely come.</p>

<p>Lightfoot, standing up in the canoe, with paddle
raised, pointed to the prisoner.</p>

<p>“She is to be the squaw of Crazy Snake!” he said,
in order to settle that matter once for all, as he saw a
number of the younger warriors regarding her with
admiring looks. “Crazy Snake placed her in my
charge, to take to the village; and with Red Antelope
I have got her thus far.”</p>

<p>In imperfect English he now ordered her to get
out of the canoe.</p>

<p>When she did not move quick enough to please him,
he caught her by the hair and half dragged her out.</p>

<p>Some of the warriors laughed, as if pleased, when
this brutal treatment brought from her a cry of pain.</p>

<p>“We wait here for Crazy Snake,” one of the braves
informed Lightfoot. “He was to meet us here with
more warriors. What word comes from the white
men?”</p>

<p>Lightfoot told them as much as he knew, or as much
as he cared to tell them.</p>

<p>There were no lodges here, and but a temporary
camping place had been made. The girl prisoner sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
on the ground, in the blazing heat of the sun, without
shelter.</p>

<p>The warriors gathered around her, some with
blankets drawn about their shoulders, but most of
them only in war paint and feathers. They were
merely disgusting brutes to her. Whatever others
might see in them that was picturesque and attractive,
she saw none of it. They were of the men who had
murdered her father, and had taken her captive, and
now held her here in their midst.</p>

<p>But most she thought of the fate of her lover, whose
body, as she believed, had been left in that gully in
the midst of the burned grasslands.</p>

<p>What the future held for her she shuddered to think,
but she knew that death would be preferable to continued
captivity with these savages.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet watched the shores of the stream and
the cañon a while, and also stationed warriors on the
tops of the hills to report the approach of any one.
They were waiting the arrival of Crazy Snake.</p>

<p>When he did not come as soon as anticipated, they
made hasty preparations for departure, intending to
ride farther down the stream to the Indian village.
The white prisoner was to be placed there, and there
were other reasons which now induced them to make
this retreat. So far, no white men had been sighted
by them.</p>

<p>Lena Forest had been anxiously hoping to learn
that white men were coming, but her hope of that
died away when she was placed on the back of a pony
and was again borne away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE WILD RANGE RIDERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The men whom old Nick Nomad gathered about
him in the town were a wild-looking lot, yet typical
of the border, particularly in the old days when Nomad
was younger and was noted as one of the most
fiery of the frontier Indian fighters.</p>

<p>Luck favored him, for there had come into the town
of Crystal Spring, at the base of the mountains, a band
of old-time bordermen, hunters, trappers, and wild-horse
catchers, with whom he was personally acquainted.</p>

<p>It had been Nomad’s intention to pick up a company
of men in the town, merchants, clerks, school teachers,
stage drivers, bartenders, gamblers, anything he could
get, even though he had small faith in the fighting
spirit of a company thus collected.</p>

<p>But that intention was set aside when he saw Lawler
and his wild range riders; and when they enrolled
under him, as they did as soon as they understood his
need and heard his appeal, the confidence of the old
trapper rose many degrees.</p>

<p>“Waugh!” he said, seizing the hand of Bill Lawler
himself, and shaking it as if it were a pump handle.
“This hyar makes me think er ther time me an’ a lot
of the boyees give ther Snake River Injuns sech a
hustle. Lawler, ’twar Providence, and no mistake,
thet sent you hyar now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>He had fought Indians with Lawler, and had
trapped and hunted with him; and this was true of
many of the men who had come into Crystal Spring
with Lawler.</p>

<p>As has been said, they were a wild-looking lot, as
they gathered round old Nick Nomad and heard his
story; and they declared their intention of “wiping
out” the Blackfeet, if that were necessary. Among
their arms, old-fashioned firearms prevailed, together
with fringed hunting garments and beaver-skin caps.
They carried hatchets and knives, after the Indian
fashion, and the horses they rode were small, wiry
Indian ponies.</p>

<p>Some of them had been drinking in the saloons, before
the old trapper arrived and made his call for
volunteers, and these hilarious ones were for riding
straight to the Blackfoot village and sweeping it out
of existence with fire and pistol.</p>

<p>“No!” said Nomad. “We goes fust thing ter Buffler,
and then we does what he says. And I thinks we
can’t git ter him any too quick ter please him.”</p>

<p>Night was at hand by the time Nomad had guided
these wild range riders to the point where he had left
Cody and Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>Neither was there, and he had hardly expected that
either would be. Nevertheless, the fact of their absence
made it impossible for Nomad and his company
of Indian fighters to push on during the darkness.
They did not wish to overrun the scouts, who were
supposed to be in advance, and Nomad was anxious to
halt there, for the coming of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>The range riders sprawled themselves for the night
along the edge of the hills, with the cañon river roaring
noisily below them.</p>

<p>No fires were built and no lights were shown.
Guards were stationed. They were in the Blackfoot
country now, and a night surprise was a thing to be
watched against. Through the night sentries kept
sharp watch; but the night passed without excitement
or incident of any kind.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, with no enemy in sight,
many of the range riders clamored to be led to the
Indian village, which they desired to attack in their
wild Bedouin fashion. But old Nomad had been with
Buffalo Bill too much to believe that he would approve
of a thing of that kind, and he held back the eager
rangers.</p>

<p>“Waugh! I’ll take a look round,” he said, “and see
what’s ter be seen, and mebbe diskiver what’s best ter
be did. I’m lookin’ fer Buffler now ever’ minute. Ef
he don’t come, then we’ll move on down ther stream,
and try ter hit his trail and foller it.”</p>

<p>He rode away in the gray dawn on Nebuchadnezzar,
promising to be back soon.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no use fer Injuns no more’n they have,”
was his thought, “and I’m agreein’ with ’em that ther
only good Injun is a dead Injun; but, jes’ ther same,
I knows thet Buffler would git hotter’n a limekiln ef
I should let them wild men charge ther Blackfeet, as
they want ter do. Ef Buffler’s fell inter ther hands of
ther cusses, why, then thet’s diff’runt; thet puts ther
responsibility and their commandin’ onter me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
reckons ef thet <em>has</em> happened, we’ll be obleeged ter
charge ther reds, and wipe ’em out, ’specially if they’ve
done any wickedness ter Buffler.”</p>

<p>He passed on down the cañon trail a long distance,
looking carefully about, and searching for “sign.”</p>

<p>He saw pony hoofs and moccasin tracks, but they
had been made early the day before, he judged, which
indicated that the men and horses that had made them
were not near.</p>

<p>Yet old Nomad was mistaking and underrating
Blackfoot cunning in that; for, as he passed on, scanning
the ground and glancing his keen, old eyes along
the hills, a number of Blackfeet were watching him.</p>

<p>They were under the leadership of Crazy Snake, as
cunning a rascal as had ever crept, serpentlike, through
the defiles of those hills.</p>

<p>There was nothing crazy about old Crazy Snake but
his name. He was shrewd, cunning, remarkably clear-headed
for an Indian, and, altogether, a dangerous redskin.
The name had been given him because of his
ferocity in a certain battle, when, surrounded by an
attacking party of Cree Indians, he had fought his way
through and escaped, after killing and wounding many
of them; he had fought as if he were a crazy snake,
and that was his name ever after.</p>

<p>Crazy Snake was now just back from the trip he
had made a number of miles to the northward, having
made a headlong ride for the purpose of getting help
from the Blackfoot village that lay at the big sink of
the Powder River. He had secured the warriors he
had gone for, and they were with him, and he was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
on his way to the lower village&mdash;his own village&mdash;where
he meant to make a mighty resistance, if the
white men came there to attack him.</p>

<p>When he saw, in the trail below, the old trapper jogging
along on his old horse, Nebuchadnezzar, he knew
from Nomad’s manner that he was searching for some
trail, or for Indian “sign.”</p>

<p>Crazy Snake knew, too, that this old trapper was
the friend and pard of the wonderful Long Hair, so
feared by all the Western Indians.</p>

<p>When he had determined the direction that Nomad
would take, Crazy Snake slipped away with several
of his best warriors, and hastened to put himself and
them in front of the trapper, in an endeavor to ambush
him.</p>

<p>Nomad, however, turned around, as if he smelled
the trap that was laid for him; and, after jogging
along a short distance, disappeared from sight of the
Blackfeet.</p>

<p>He had struck a trail that excited his curiosity. It
was the plain trail of a white man, and the white man
seemed to be wounded, or suffering. The tracks wavered
here and there.</p>

<p>“Got an Injun arrer in him, I’m guessin’,” was
Nomad’s opinion. “’Tain’t Buffler’s trail, ner Pawnee’s;
and I dunno who it kin be. But whoever he
aire, he aire white; and I’ll see what’s the meanin’
of it.”</p>

<p>The trail was fresh and plain, and he followed it
rapidly.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to come in sight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
small hut half hidden under a projecting ledge. The
door was open, and the wavering trail led through
the grass straight up to it.</p>

<p>“Some fool miner’s camped down hyar, and didn’t
know thet ther cussed Blackfeet aire threatenin’ all
white men’s ha’r!” was Nomad’s conclusion, as he
left the trail, dismounted, and then approached the
house carefully from the rear, looking into the hut
through the one small rear window.</p>

<p>A man lay on the floor by the door, seeming to have
fallen there through sheer weakness.</p>

<p>Nomad immediately went around to the door.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, stepping within. “Got some Injun
lead in ye?” His tone changed to astonishment. “Bill
Givens!” he cried. “Waugh! Ole pard, what’s ther
meanin’ o’ this?”</p>

<p>The meaning of it was that Bill Givens, an old acquaintance
of Nomad’s, was ill of measles, and in a
dangerous condition. He had got home, and tried to
get into the house and on his bed, but had fallen on
the floor.</p>

<p>Nomad knew what the trouble was as soon as he
looked in Givens’ splotched and fevered face; but he
had no fear of measles; and, picking Givens up, he
put him on the narrow bed, and then tried to do something
for him to make him comfortable.</p>

<p>“Been ground-hoggin’ out hyar by yerself, eh?
Tryin’ ter git some of the yaller gold thet everybody
’lows these hyar hills aire sloppin’ over with, eh?
Waugh! You’d ought to ’a’ got out o’ this ’fore ther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
measles hit ye, fer ther Blackfeet aire thick as flies
round hyar, and aire likely ter make trouble.”</p>

<p>He was puzzled as to what he should do.</p>

<p>When he had worked over Givens a while, and had
poured some hot water down his throat, water heated
in the tiny fireplace, Givens came, in a measure, to himself.</p>

<p>He knew that Blackfeet were around in that locality,
and now, seeing and recognizing his old trapper pard,
he begged Nomad to take him down to the town, or
at least away from the cabin so surrounded by Indian
perils.</p>

<p>“It’s resky, but not so resky as you stayin’ hyar,
even if somebody stayed hyar with ye, Givens,” said
Nomad. “I reckon I kin help ye stick ter ther back
of my ole hoss, and we’ll git ye back to whar ther
rangers aire waitin’, and then have some of ’em stay
by ye, er git ye to ther town. I never deserts an ole
pard, Givens, and I’ll not desert you.”</p>

<p>Nomad got Nebuchadnezzar, and with some difficulty
helped the sick man to mount to the horse’s back.
Then he took the rein, and, with Givens swaying
weakly in the saddle, he set out with him, striking the
backward trail and hurrying on toward the camp of
the rangers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Crazy Snake had not been inactive; he
had drawn his cordon of Blackfeet warriors and descended
into the trail.</p>

<p>Suddenly rifle shots rang out and bowstrings
twanged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span></p>

<p>Givens fell, with a bullet in his brain, tumbling
heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>Bullets cut through Nomad’s clothing, and an arrow
struck and stuck in his beaver-skin cap, its feathered
end projecting from the fur, forming a strange-looking
plume.</p>

<p>Nomad tried to turn Nebuchadnezzar around in the
trail, but the Blackfoot rush was made too quickly;
and, though he went down fighting, he was subdued,
and made a prisoner, being beaten to the earth before
he submitted.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar pawed and squealed, rushed on the
Blackfeet with his greenish teeth clicking and snapping,
and lunged out with his twinkling heels; but
Nebuchadnezzar, too, was made a prisoner.</p>

<p>Nomad’s effort to aid a needy friend had made him
a prisoner of the Blackfeet.</p>

<span class="fs70">AGAIN ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill floated on down the
cañon river until they came to the open land beyond
the “tunnel,” where they discovered indications that
Blackfeet had been on the shores there not long before.</p>

<p>This made them wary; they could not be sure that
all the Blackfeet were gone. Accordingly, they concealed
their canoe, and searched the ground along the
shore.</p>

<p>Bruce Clayton was with them, using his eyes as well
as he could, but unable to “read” what he saw on the
ground, seeing but hoof marks of horses, and some
moccasin tracks in the damp soil by the margin of
the river.</p>

<p>“They have retreated toward the village,” said Buffalo
Bill. “Their village lies farther down the stream,
and they have gone in that direction. The girl was
taken with them, evidently.”</p>

<p>Clayton wanted to hurry on and do something at
once to rescue her, but the wary scouts were not sure
this was wise. They feared ambushes, and knew, also,
that they were not in force strong enough to take the
girl from the village. Whatever they did they must do
by craft.</p>

<p>Aside from this, Buffalo Bill was expecting soon the
coming of old Nick Nomad, who had gone for assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>He now sent Pawnee Bill back to meet Nomad’s
force and guide it on, and, with the anxious young
lover, he began to follow the trail of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Avoiding all ambushes and pitfalls, but making slow
progress, the scout and his young friend reached the
vicinity of the Blackfoot village by the middle of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>From a hillside some distance away the scout surveyed
it with his glasses, and saw that the village was
in a state of commotion.</p>

<p>“Impossible to do anything right now,” was his
conclusion. “The warriors we’ve been following are
there, and the village is aroused and is being put in
readiness for a fight. It would be as much as our
lives are worth if we should try to penetrate it now.
We’ll have to await the coming of Nomad, and whatever
help he has got together.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could go in after dark,” said young Clayton
rashly.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” was the answer. “Nomad may get
here by, or before, that time.”</p>

<p>But Nomad did not come.</p>

<p>When darkness had settled over the earth the scout
tried to enter the village, but was driven back by the
keen-nosed dogs, that swarmed everywhere, watchful
and hungry as wolves.</p>

<p>“If only we could get some word to her!” said Clayton.
“If we could let her know that friends are near,
it would encourage her.”</p>

<p>“My attempt kicked up a good deal of excitement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
She may guess from that that friends are near. We’ll
hope so.”</p>

<p>“But if only some direct word could be got to her!”</p>

<p>Clayton’s anxiety increased as the hours went by.</p>

<p>“If you can’t sleep, my boy,” said the scout after a
while, “keep close watch while I take a try at it. I’ll
be better to-morrow for a little rest to-night.”</p>

<p>“You don’t intend to attempt again to-night to reach
her?” said Clayton.</p>

<p>“It’s impossible to do anything to-night, my dear
fellow; the Blackfeet are too much excited and too
wide-awake.”</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill awoke, less than an hour later,
Bruce Clayton was gone.</p>

<p>“The fool!” he said. “He’s certain to be captured,
if he tries to get into the village.”</p>

<p>He rose and went again toward the village, filled
with fear for his friend’s safety. He sympathized
with Clayton’s anxiety to do something for the girl
who was held by the Blackfeet, but at the same time
blamed him for folly and disobedience of orders.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when wild yells and a noisy
clamor told him that Clayton had been captured.</p>

<p>The scout stood still, listening to those telltale
sounds.</p>

<p>“Just as I feared,” he thought. “It will be a wonder
if they don’t kill him; and what good will his
recklessness then do the girl?”</p>

<p>He moved on with quick steps, being guided by the
wild clamor and by the flashing of lodge fires that were
being rebuilt, or blown into new life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>Drums were soon booming in the council lodge,
warriors were seen hurrying to and fro by the light
of the fires, and feverish activity reigned.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet, having captured the young white
man, were sure that he was a scout, and that a strong
force of white men were near; and they were getting
ready to meet them if they came.</p>

<p>The utter impossibility of entering the village without
discovery was apparent to the experienced scout.
Though he wanted to aid the youth, and also the girl,
he saw that the attempt would have small chance of
success, and if it failed his own fate would, no doubt,
be sealed. Yet it required stern self-repression to remain
inactive, knowing what was going on so near
him, and the peril of the prisoners.</p>

<p>As Buffalo Bill lay close against the ground,
screened by the darkness, he saw small bodies of
Blackfeet leave the village, and knew they had been
sent out to scout about, and, if possible, to locate the
white men who were supposed to be near.</p>

<p>In going and coming these Blackfeet passed close to
the scout; so close that he could hear some of their
low-spoken words and the soft crunching of their moccasins.
From what they said he discovered that Crazy
Snake was not in the village, but was expected soon,
and that the prisoners were being held until his coming.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” was his thought. “Crazy Snake
wants the girl for his squaw, and these bloodthirsty
rascals believe that he will give up Clayton to the torture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
as soon as he arrives. Before that time comes perhaps
I can do something.”</p>

<p>He slipped away from the village, and soon was
hastening over the backward way, hoping to get in
communication now with Nomad’s men and hurry
them forward, and also eager to find Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>However, he discovered that parties of Blackfeet
were coming and going in the trail, and to avoid running
into them he left it and entered the hills. This
slowed his progress, and morning dawned before he
had gone very far. Then, as he went on, he was
given a crushing surprise.</p>

<p>He saw old Nomad, mounted on Nebuchadnezzar,
in the midst of a body of Blackfeet commanded by
Crazy Snake.</p>

<p>“Nomad a prisoner!” he said, with a groan. “What
in blazes will happen next?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CAPTURE OF THE MEDICINE MAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Unable to do anything to aid Nomad, who was surrounded
by a strong body of warriors, Buffalo Bill
continued his retreat toward the point where he hoped
to, at least, find Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>That sight of Nomad borne away by the redskins
inclined him to think that the trapper had failed in
his effort to get fighting men from the town.</p>

<p>But when he found Pawnee Bill, he found also the
wild range riders whom Nomad had led into the hills.
They had met Pawnee Bill, and had been waiting Nomad’s
return, unaware that he had fallen into the
hands of the Indians.</p>

<p>They greeted the noted scout with cheers. He was
known personally to most of them, and by reputation
to all. But their cheers changed to angry calls for
vengeance when they learned what had befallen Nomad;
and they asked the scout to lead them toward
the village at once.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was pleased with the force that had
been rallied by Nomad. As fighting men, they were
the best of the border; and he believed they would be
able to whip the Blackfeet even in a stand-up fight.</p>

<p>But the result to the prisoners was a thing that had
to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>If the Blackfeet were defeated in an open battle and
driven back, the surviving remnant would seek shelter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
in the mountains. But before retreating they would,
without doubt, slay their white prisoners. Victory at
such a cost of human life would be purchased all too
dearly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Buffalo Bill now set himself at the
head of the rangers, and led them at as rapid a pace
as was safe in the direction of the Blackfoot village.</p>

<p>Lawler, the commander of the rangers, rode at the
scout’s side, and so did Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>As they went, they discussed the situation with reference
to the safety of the prisoners, and agreed that
by some strategy they should be reached and rescued,
if possible. How the thing was to be done was the
puzzle.</p>

<p>As the village was approached the rangers slowed
their pace, and the two noted scouts were sent ahead.</p>

<p>They separated when in the hills overhanging the
village, going in different directions, on the watch for
Indian spies, and trying to ascertain the state of affairs.</p>

<p>When he had gone some distance Buffalo Bill dismounted
and descended on foot a few yards, to where
a slight rise offered a better view. He had got his
field glasses and was preparing for a careful study of
conditions in the village when he was aroused by a
sound from his horse and by a sudden patter of moccasined
feet. Turning about, he saw an Indian warrior
running to get the horse.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill did not wish to shoot the brave, lest
the report of the shot should carry too far; so he
rushed at the redskin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>

<p>The latter tried to leap to the back of the horse,
but succeeded only in dislodging the scout’s rifle, which
hung by its strap to the high pommel.</p>

<p>The horse reared, shaking off the Indian, and the
Indian, seeing that he was in danger, turned about.
He slipped and fell in his haste, dropping his shield
of buffalo hide, but retaining his lance; and then he
sprang away.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill reached his horse, cut the lariat,
bounded into the saddle, and gave chase, almost weaponless,
though he had caught up the shield, which the
redskin had dropped.</p>

<p>As he thus gave chase, the Blackfoot stood at bay,
and when the scout tried to ride him down he hurled
the lance straight at the scout’s broad breast.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill dodged, and caught the Indian’s lance
on the shield; otherwise, it would have gone through
his body. But he rode the horse right over the warrior,
and, lunging at him from the saddle, he caught
the redskin by the throat, when both came to the
ground together, the scout on top.</p>

<p>The fight that followed was furious and desperate,
but of brief duration. When it ended, Buffalo Bill
was the victor, and the Blackfoot brave lay panting
on his back, the scout’s fingers clutching him by the
throat.</p>

<p>The red warrior gurgled something which he meant
as a word of submission and surrender, but the scout
still held him in that choking grasp, not daring to trust
him; and then, before the brave could get back enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
strength to resist, the scout had him bound tight and
fast.</p>

<p>When the Blackfoot recovered sufficiently to talk,
Buffalo Bill began to ask him questions, emphasizing
them by a pointed revolver.</p>

<p>The warrior was sullen at first; but by and by he
declared that his name was Spotted Deer, and that he
was a subchief, who had been sent out there to meet
and guide into the village a certain medicine man from
another village, who was coming to drive away the
evil spirits that were causing the Blackfeet to fall sick
and die. In other words, this medicine man had been
sent for in the belief that he could charm away the
measles that had attacked so many of the Indians.</p>

<p>“I think I want to meet that medicine man,” said
the scout to himself, when he had heard the story.
Therefore, he went into hiding, with his prisoner
bound and gagged, his horse concealed some distance
away, and waited with as much patience as he could
for the appearance of the medicine man.</p>

<p>As he thus waited, he shaped the plan that had
come to his fertile mind&mdash;a plan that promised aid to
the imperiled prisoners.</p>

<p>Within less than an hour the medicine man came in
sight, advancing down the trail that here descended
from the higher mountains.</p>

<p>Spotted Deer, though bound and gagged, struggled
and gurgled, in an effort to warn the medicine man
of the danger he was in, and he threw himself about
in such a manner, in spite of the scout’s warnings to
him to desist, that he attracted the medicine man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
attention. Yet the result of his strenuous efforts was
not what he had hoped.</p>

<p>The medicine man turned toward the bushes where
he beheld the commotion, stepping with Indian lightness
of foot, and when he parted the bushes to look
in, he found himself looking into the deadly tube of a
revolver, with the dreaded Long Hair behind it
threatening him.</p>

<p>“Do not try to turn!” the scout commanded in
Blackfoot; “for, if you do, I shall shoot you.”</p>

<p>The medicine man surrendered without a word,
seeing that death would be the result if he refused.
Then he discovered the bound form of Spotted Deer.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill kept him covered with the revolver, and
with Indian stoicism the medicine man sat down.</p>

<p>“Now, your knife!” commanded the scout.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot produced the weapon and placed it
on the ground. His hatchet was the only other weapon
he possessed, and that he also surrendered.</p>

<p>Then the scout searched him.</p>

<p>Under his blanket the medicine man had what may
be called the tools of his trade&mdash;his medicine rattle
and drum, pigments and paints of various kinds, his
medicine bag, together with plumes, beadwork, and
other adornments.</p>

<p>When he had possessed himself of these, Buffalo
Bill tied the medicine man, and bound him to the other
captured Blackfoot. Then he tied to the saddle on
the back of the horse the articles taken from the medicine
man, and, leading his horse, he drove the two Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
before him along the trail in the direction from
which he had come.</p>

<p>An hour later Buffalo Bill reached the wild range
riders, without mishap, with his prisoners and spoil,
finding that Pawnee Bill had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>But Pawnee Bill came in soon, while the scout was
explaining and elaborating the plan he had conceived
for the relief of the white prisoners of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>It was so daring, however, that when Pawnee Bill
heard it even he opposed it; for the plan was nothing
less than that Buffalo Bill should paint and disguise
himself and enter the Blackfoot village, pretending to
be the medicine man whom the Indians were expecting.</p>

<p>But when Buffalo Bill had painted himself with the
paints taken from the medicine man, had arranged his
hair in the Indian fashion and ornamented it with
plumes, had put on the clothing of the medicine man,
wrapped himself in the medicine man’s blanket and
robes, and arrayed himself, with tom-tom, medicine
rattle, and other articles, even Pawnee Bill’s skepticism
vanished.</p>

<p>“It almost frightens me to look at you now, Cody,”
he said, with a laugh. “If you can get into the village
in the night rigged out in that way, I think you can
fool even old Crazy Snake himself. But we shall
stand ready to rush the village if anything happens to
you. Give us the signal&mdash;two wolf howls from the
village&mdash;and we’ll charge the redskins, whatever the
cost.”</p>

<p>The range riders were as enthusiastic as Pawnee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Bill had now become, and though they were themselves
somewhat experienced in such trickery, they marveled
at the skill shown by Buffalo Bill in this transformation.</p>

<p>With the approach of night the range riders advanced
toward the village, with scouts out in front to
guard against surprise and ambush. But they stopped
in the hills above the village.</p>

<p>Then, as night came on, dark and cloudy, Buffalo
Bill descended from the hills. He knew the terrible
danger to which he was now to expose himself&mdash;that
he was taking his life in his hands. Yet he did not
hesitate at this call of duty.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE COMING OF THE MEDICINE MAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lena Forest’s position in the Blackfoot village could
hardly have been worse, for the malignity of two jealous
Indian women was turned against her in every
possible way to make her suffer.</p>

<p>These two women were Wind Flower and Wide
Foot, the wife of Crazy Snake. Wide Foot had been
told that Crazy Snake, her lord and master, was to
install the new white squaw soon in his lodge, and that
was enough to fill her heart with bitter enmity against
the inoffensive white girl.</p>

<p>As for Wind Flower, she could not rid herself of
the belief that Lightfoot, the handsome young chief
who had promised to marry her, was stricken with
the charms of the white girl prisoner. And as Lightfoot
would probably be made head chief in the event
of the death of Crazy Snake, Wind Flower saw herself
at some future time dispossessed, as Wide Foot
seemed about to be now.</p>

<p>Lena Forest had been placed in Crazy Snake’s lodge
in charge of Wide Foot, who was ordered to care for
her, and to see that she did not escape; and this Wide
Foot was commanded to do on peril of her own life.</p>

<p>Though fear of Crazy Snake, whose anger was a
thing to be dreaded, was enough to keep Wide Foot
from doing the white girl harm of a serious character,
it did not prevent her from annoying the prisoner in
many ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>At times both Wide Foot and Wind Flower would
sit in the lodge entrance and make sport of the prisoner,
grimacing, giggling at her, making faces at her,
even spitting at her, to show their hatred and detestation.</p>

<p>Wide Foot even refused to give her food and water,
withholding them until the white girl was fairly famished.</p>

<p>When Bruce Clayton was captured by the Blackfeet
and brought into the village, Lena Forest’s prison-keeper
tried to prevent her from knowing it. But
the knowledge could not be long withheld. The Blackfeet
were altogether too jubilant over the capture,
and made too great a noise about it.</p>

<p>Lena Forest discovered that a prisoner had been
brought in. When she tried to get out of the lodge,
and was thrown back by Wide Foot, and then heard
Bruce’s loud voice raised in anger at some insult,
she hurled Wide Foot aside, and dashed out of the
lodge.</p>

<p>She saw her lover seated on a horse, to which he
was tied, with a band of howling redskins round him,
composed, in large part, of frantic women and children.</p>

<p>But for a guard of warriors the angry squaws
would have pulled Clayton from the horse and hacked
him to pieces with knives.</p>

<p>Lena Forest tried to reach Bruce, hardly knowing
what she did; for this sudden discovery that he was
not really dead, but that he, too, was a Blackfoot
prisoner, nerved her to the highest pitch of excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and recklessness. She had no thought of what she
would do, or could do, if she gained his side; but was
only possessed by an insane desire to get to him, and
die with him, if she could do nothing else.</p>

<p>Wide Foot took savage delight in seizing her and
dragging her by the hair back into the lodge. But
the despondent girl had come to the knowledge that
her lover was alive, when she had thought him dead,
and the cruelty and abuse of the frenzied old woman
made little impression on her now.</p>

<p>True, she feared now for Bruce’s life; yet while
there is life there is hope, and that he had been spared
thus far gave glimmerings of hope for the future.</p>

<p>When the old trapper, Nick Nomad, was brought
into the village there was further wild commotion
among the Blackfeet, of which the girl prisoner could
not fail to have knowledge.</p>

<p>She was sure that Bruce still lived, and was held
in some of the lodges.</p>

<p>She saw the trapper on his rawboned horse, as he
was conducted past the lodge entrance in a sort of
triumphal entry made by Crazy Snake himself; and
from the shouts she knew that some big chief had arrived
and guessed it was Crazy Snake. Then she saw
Crazy Snake, and was sure of this.</p>

<p>Throughout the remaining hours, until darkness
came, the girl prisoner tried to think of some means
by which she might release herself and the other prisoners.</p>

<p>The wariness of the old squaw had increased since
the coming of Crazy Snake. No more did Wide Foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
beat and abuse the captive, a thing she feared to do
now, lest the vengeance of Crazy Snake should descend
on her.</p>

<p>Lena Forest listened to the thumping of the drums
in the council lodge, and to the fervid oratory of the
warriors after nightfall. She knew that things of importance
were being discussed in that big lodge, yet she
could tell nothing of what was being said, even though
much of the talk reached her ears, for she knew not a
word of the language. Held close now under the eyes
of the old squaw, the girl crouched in the half-lighted
prison lodge, listening to this commotion.</p>

<p>Dogs barked, and papooses and squaws talked in the
midst of the lodges. Warriors hurried to and fro, and
Lena believed that scouts and spies were passing in
and out of the village.</p>

<p>All of this made her think that perhaps white men
were near, whom the Indians feared; and she thought
of Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill, for whose coming
she now prayed.</p>

<p>But when at length Buffalo Bill came she had no
thought that he was a white man.</p>

<p>The daring scout had made his entrance into the
village in the most natural way, riding into it on the
back of an Indian pony, arrayed in a medicine robe
and blanket, painted until his features were concealed,
and with his mustache and imperial hidden beneath the
folds of the blanket which he kept muffled up around
his chin.</p>

<p>Only the upper part of his face, wonderfully striped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
with paint, his feathered hair, and his eyes could be
seen.</p>

<p>He announced his presence, before entering, by a
series of wild yells, and a rattle of his medicine drum;
and when the Blackfeet swarmed forth to meet him,
he told them briefly, and in well-chosen Blackfoot
words, that he was the medicine man who had been
asked to come to conjure away the demons that were
making the Blackfeet fall ill and die.</p>

<p>Peril of the most deadly sort confronted him instantly,
for Crazy Snake stepped forth, and, looking
keenly at him, said:</p>

<p>“This is not Wandering Bear, the great medicine
man of the Blackfeet of the Sunken Lands?”</p>

<p>But Buffalo Bill was ready even for that.</p>

<p>“I am Whispering Elk, the Blackfoot medicine man
from the far North,” he answered. “Wandering Bear
has gone to the Blackfeet of the Sagebrush Valley,
where there is much sickness, and I come in his stead.”</p>

<p>Crazy Snake, shrewd as he was, did not doubt that
this was an Indian medicine man; but he had met
Wandering Bear, and this man did not resemble him.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, on his Indian pony, was conducted toward
the council lodge. Before it was reached, he was
asked to stop at a lodge and cure a warrior stricken
with measles.</p>

<p>While not believing that he could do anything more,
perhaps, than give the stricken warrior hope, the scout
descended carefully from the pony and entered the
lodge.</p>

<p>The Indian braves, the women and children, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
even the suspicious sniffing dogs came close at his
heels, filling the lodge which he entered.</p>

<p>The sick man, his face lighted by the leaping fire
of the lodge, which had been stirred into new life,
looked appealingly at the supposed medicine man.</p>

<p>For a minute, in the midst of a great silence, Buffalo
Bill postured before the sick man. Then, with a quick
motion, and some shouted words, he stooped and drew
from under the skins that covered the sick man the
stuffed skin of a weasel, which he had concealed under
his robe. This he threw on the ground with a yell,
and then beat and tore it into fragments, casting the
fragments into the fire, that the Blackfeet might not
too closely inspect them.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet yelled in hoarse joy and triumph
when they beheld what they believed to be the body
of the evil spirit, taking the shape of a weasel, that
had vexed and sickened the warrior.</p>

<p>The warrior’s face glowed and his eyes brightened;
and there was a certainty that, believing now he would
get well, much of the battle against the disease had
been already won by him.</p>

<p>As the scout came out of this lodge the girl prisoner,
Lena Forest, saw him again; but he was still to
her but a medicine man, a horrid and horrible creature,
worse even than the hideous Indians who had
surrounded her so much of late. She saw him go
on toward the council lodge, and heard there the renewed
beating of drums, and a repetition of the sounds
of Indian oratory.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, in thus desperately entering the Blackfoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
village, hoped to locate the prisoners, and, later in
the night, release them. If he was discovered, his
own life would be the forfeit, he felt sure.</p>

<p>The risk was great, but the thing to be gained was
great, for it was no less than the release of old Nomad
and the other prisoners, thus saving their lives; for
he was certain they would be slain by the Blackfeet, if
the latter were forced to retreat by an attack of the
range riders.</p>

<p>In the council lodge Buffalo Bill tried to conduct
himself like a true medicine man. He yelled and
danced, and besought the good spirits of the mountains
to descend and assist him in driving out the evil
spirits that were vexing the Blackfeet. But he did
not dare talk too much, and much of his eloquence
took the shape of pantomime, in which he used wonderful
gestures, always keeping the folds of the blanket
over the lower part of his face&mdash;which gave him an
additional air of mystery to the frenzied Indians.</p>

<p>He discovered that one thing the Blackfeet were
anxious about was that he should confer on them some
power, by a spell or charm, that would enable them to
resist the bullets of the white men, whom they feared.</p>

<p>The scout gave them whatever assurances they desired,
feeling that he could not safely do otherwise.</p>

<p>Finally he left the council lodge, declaring that the
spirits had told him that, concealed in some of the
lodges, were little demons, hid under buffalo robes,
and even in the earth, who were working much evil,
and he must find and destroy them.</p>

<p>His object, of course, was to pass from lodge to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
lodge, in order to locate the prisoners, and if possible
communicate to them knowledge of the thing he was
trying to do.</p>

<p>The warriors streamed after him, and behind the
warriors came the women and children, while the barking
and sniffing dogs ran everywhere, yelping and
snarling.</p>

<p>It did not take Buffalo Bill long to find out that
Nomad and young Clayton were held together in a
lodge near the medicine lodge.</p>

<p>“Now, if I can locate the girl,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>The braves were crowding round him, and he dared
not say a word in English which would let Nomad
and Clayton know who he was, and his disguise and
his acting were so good that they did not recognize
him. But he contrived to make himself known to
old Nomad by a few words of Spanish, and he saw
the old man stare in confusion and astonishment.</p>

<p>In a little while he found Lena Forest, crouching in
the lodge where she had been held from the first.</p>

<p>At the entrance to this lodge stood old Wide Foot,
who fell back when the terrible medicine man appeared
before her.</p>

<p>Lena Forest started up, frightened by the entrance
of the medicine man.</p>

<p>Not daring to use English, the scout said a few
words in Spanish, wondering if she would understand.
She uttered a cry of amazement, for she understood
him&mdash;a cry which was fairly forced from her by her
wild astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<p>Buffalo Bill poked and peered, said a few words
more to her in Spanish, the Indians thinking them
words of invocation which they could not be expected
to understand, and then he retreated.</p>

<p>As he did so, coming thus out of the lodge, he
heard wild yells, and a rushing of feet. And then
before him, bounding along, his eyes blazing and his
whole being wrought to a frenzy, he saw the medicine
man whom he had captured, and whom he was impersonating.</p>

<p>With yells of rage the medicine man rushed upon
him, denouncing him, and screaming to the warriors
that this was a white man, and must be beaten down
and captured; that he was the terrible Long Hair
himself!</p>

<p>It was like the explosion of a mine of gunpowder.
Instantly, a dozen warriors sprang at Buffalo Bill,
tearing the blanket from his shoulders, and yelling
with rage as their enemy stood revealed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE DEFEAT OF THE BLACKFEET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Wandering Bear, the medicine man captured by
Buffalo Bill, was a shrewd old scoundrel, gifted not
only with many natural qualities, but some acquired
ones, for the part he played as medicine man of the
Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Like most, if not all, medicine men among savage
peoples, he resorted to tricks, some of them very
clever; and one of his tricks was akin to that shown
on many a theatrical stage to-day, the getting out of
tightly set cords bound about his wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>For a long time after darkness fell, old Wandering
Bear lay twisting quietly at the cords that held
him.</p>

<p>He had seen Buffalo Bill paint and decorate himself
and depart, and he guessed shrewdly what that
meant.</p>

<p>Also he saw that the white rangers were close down
to the village, in the scrub that covered the sides of
the hills, and he was sure that an attack on the village
was contemplated, and that the departure of the
pretended medicine man had something to do with
it and could mean nothing but harm to the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>He thought most of himself and his personal peril,
as was but natural. What these white men would
do to him eventually he did not know, but he anticipated
nothing less than death. As for the other Blackfoot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the one who had come to meet him and had been
captured by Buffalo Bill, Wandering Bear paid slight
attention to him; his own safety was the thing for
which he longed and now worked.</p>

<p>At last the cords on his wrists fell away, and by
some clever twisting he got his hands down to his
ankles and untied the cords that held them.</p>

<p>After thus releasing himself, he lay a while, stretching
his arms and legs, to get them in condition. Then
suddenly he bounded to his feet with a startling yell,
knocked over the ranger who stood close by him, and
was gone like a shot out of a gun.</p>

<p>The rangers did not even fire a shot at him, for
they did not wish to announce to the Blackfeet below
that they were so close to the village. Yet they pursued
the escaping medicine man, a pursuit that was
hopeless from the first.</p>

<p>He disappeared, to appear in the Blackfoot village,
leaping on and denouncing Buffalo Bill, to the amazement
of the Blackfeet who heard and saw him.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill knew that the game was up. If he
escaped with his life he would have to move quickly,
and do something desperate.</p>

<p>Instantly two wolf howls rose on the startled air,
floating out to the wild range riders in the near-by
hills. Then the scout struck down the medicine man,
who was trying to seize him, and darted into the lodge
of Crazy Snake.</p>

<p>Lena Forest was in there, and at the entrance was
Wide Foot.</p>

<p>The intruder hurled the old hag sprawling; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
caught the girl by the hand and jumped to the rear
of the lodge. His knife flashed, and a tearing sound
followed, as he ripped the lodge skin from top to
bottom, opening a way through.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said, and he pulled the girl along,
while the howls of the Indians rose in a very pandemonium.</p>

<p>By diving thus through the lodge Buffalo Bill gained
a slight start of his foes, but it was only enough to
enable him to get out of the lodge and run toward the
shadows of the next one, for the angry Blackfeet
came swarming around the lodge and through it, yelling
for his life.</p>

<p>He shaped his course toward the lodge where Nomad
and Clayton were held, and gained it a few yards
in advance of his pursuers. Here he thrust the
knife into the hands of the startled and wildly excited
girl.</p>

<p>“They’re in there,” he said; “release them while I
hold back the Indians. Jump lively!”</p>

<p>She rushed into the lodge with the knife, the Indian
who had been guarding it having deserted his post.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill stepped into the entrance; and, turning
about there, he drew his revolver and shot down
the foremost of the oncoming redskins.</p>

<p>As the reports of his revolver broke forth, from
the hills came the wild, charging cheers of the range
riders, who had heard and were now answering the
wolf howls.</p>

<p>The charging cheers of the rangers and his own
revolver fire checked the advance of the enraged Blackfeet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Lena Forest was thus given time in which to
release old Nomad and her lover.</p>

<p>They came to the lodge entrance hurriedly, putting
themselves by the side of the scout.</p>

<p>“If we had weepons, Buffler!” old Nomad panted,
“we’d lay out a few of them howlin’ red devils!”</p>

<p>Clayton was too astounded to speak; but he caught
the girl in his arms and seemed resolved to shield her
by placing his body between her and the angry Blackfeet.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill reached under his blanket, and, pulling
out a loaded revolver, passed it to Nomad, who received
it with a yell of joy.</p>

<p>“Waugh! Buffler, we stand tergether and we go
down tergether. Whoop!”</p>

<p>The startled Blackfeet were not given much time
in which to rally, for already the thunder of the pony
hoofs of the charging range riders was heard beyond
the village. Then the wild riders were in the very village
itself, shooting and yelling, and the Blackfeet
were in flight.</p>

<p>Short and sharp was that surprise and that battle.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet who were not killed or captured fled
to the hills for refuge. However, numbers of them
were captured, and the village was given to the flames.</p>

<p>Old Crazy Snake escaped, with his principal warriors,
among them the handsome young chief, Lightfoot,
and the crafty medicine man, Wandering Bear.</p>

<p>A week later Crazy Snake sent down a piteous petition,
assuring the white men that he was their good
friend, that he had always been their good friend, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
would be their good friend forever, if they would but
stop chasing him in the mountains.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Blackfoot uprising, and no more
the bloody arrow, the mark of Crazy Snake’s vengeance,
gleamed red on the bosoms of men murdered by
that treacherous old chieftain. He had been soundly
whipped; and a whipped Indian can be the meekest
creature on the earth.</p>

</div>


<p>Nevertheless, in spite of this welcome lull after the
storm, Major Clendenning was determined to take no
chances of a minor outbreak on the part of the surviving
members of the Blackfoot band. He had learned
from Buffalo Bill something of the haughty nature
and indomitable ambition of the younger chief, Lightfoot;
and he had good reason to fear that the Blackfeet
would not long remain in their refuge among the
hills. Whether they would again molest the whites,
particularly the miners, or confine their hostile attentions
to their constant foes, the Crees, was an open
question, and Major Clendenning felt certain that the
great scout could solve it. He, therefore, dispatched
Buffalo Bill to the territory formerly occupied by
Crazy Snake’s tribe, with instructions to find out as
much as possible.</p>

<p>Having left Lena Forest in charge of the kindly
wife of one of the officers at the fort, and having said
farewell to Pawnee Bill, old Nomad, and Bruce Clayton&mdash;who
promised Lena that he would ride over to
the fort as often as he possibly could, and that he
would work hard and save enough money for them
to be married&mdash;Buffalo Bill mounted and rode forth
to new adventures, in which his friends were destined
to share.</p>

<p>He shaped his course directly toward the high hills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and on the evening of the third day of his journey
he found himself entering a thick forest of scrub oaks
and pines. As the shadows of night were deepening,
he decided to camp in a favorable spot; so he tethered
his horse, climbed farther up the mountain, spread
a blanket on the ground, and, carefully building a small
fire, cooked his frugal meal. After that, he dozed
peacefully and soon fell into profound slumber.</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning he was startled by
the smell of burning pine needles and the sight of
clouds of smoke drifting between the trees. The
ground was a solid carpet of pine needles, inches deep,
and this was now a carpet of flame. The fire climbed
the trees, throwing out red banners, wrapping the
straight pines in roaring fire.</p>

<p>In front of the scout was the edge of a precipice
overhanging the Bitter Water that here cut through
the solid rock of its deep cañon chasm.</p>

<p>Yet sheer as was that precipice, and far down as
were the waters of the little river, Buffalo Bill seemed
almost on the point of leaping down.</p>

<p>The mountain was steep, and he had left his horse
near its base, climbing himself to the rugged spot
where he now stood. He was trapped. Where he
stood there was a narrow space of rock, on the edge
of the precipice; in front of him a small space of
needle-covered ground still untouched by fire; and beyond
that a very furnace of flame and smoke. The
roar of the fire was terrifying of itself, and now and
then the fall of a burned tree trunk thundered through
it, like the crash of a cannon shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span></p>

<p>“My own fault, too!” he said, as he looked about,
searching vainly for some avenue of escape. “I don’t
know that I slept so soundly that the fire got such a
start as that. I suppose I must have thought it the
roar of the river.”</p>

<p>But Buffalo Bill could not be quite sure that all the
fault was with himself. For, who had started the fire?
He had deadly enemies in that country, men who
would have roasted him there as coolly as they would
have roasted a plucked partridge.</p>

<p>But Buffalo Bill was not really troubling his mind so
much about the origin of the fire as how he could
escape from it. He ran along the edge of the precipice,
looking down.</p>

<p>The lariat that might have helped him he had left
on the saddle, with the horse.</p>

<p>Twenty feet below him, on the side of the precipice,
was a ledge; but he could not get down to it, for the
wall above it was as smooth as a board, and glassy in
its slipperiness. To jump down to that ledge would
be the same as deliberately committing suicide; for the
ledge was narrow, and the drop sheer, so that he would
only have bounded, or fallen, on down into the black
cañon, if he had tried it. <ins class="corr" id="tn217" title="Transcriber’s Note—“He could see the white water rearing” changed to “He could see the white water roaring”.">He could see the white water roaring</ins>
and racing far below; and could even see other ledges and shelves
that he might reach if he could only get down to that first one.</p>

<p>Seeing that he could not climb down the sheer wall,
he turned, and again faced the fire.</p>

<p>Even in the few brief moments spent in inspecting
the ledge, the fire had gained in a startling way, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
was now much closer and much hotter than before. It
roared and glowed in a big semicircle, the two ends
of the semicircle resting on the rim of the precipice
and traveling fast toward him. That he would be
roasted alive if he remained admitted of not a doubt;
as even now, at the distance, the heat of the fire was
almost unbearable.</p>

<p>A strange look, perhaps never before seen on the
face of the indomitable scout, came to it, and he took
out his revolver. For the instant he felt that he preferred
to shoot himself rather than to suffer the tortures
of a living death by fire. But he shook his head,
thrust back the revolver, and turned again to the rim
of the precipice.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could tear up my clothes and make a
rope that would reach part way to the ledge, and I
could drop the rest of the distance,” was his thought.
“I’ll try it; for I’ll die here if I don’t, and I’d prefer
to die trying to do something.”</p>

<p>He was about to strip off his coat, when a shout
reached him. It came so suddenly and unexpectedly
that it made his heart jump.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he yelled, springing to the edge of the chasm
and looking about. He did not see any one. “Where
are you?” he called, his heart jumping with excitement
and new hope.</p>

<p>“Here!” The voice had a singular sound, shrill and
feminine.</p>

<p>He ran along the edge of the chasm, looking down,
for it seemed to come from below; and again he
shouted an inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span></p>

<p>Then he saw the figure of a young woman, who
was on one of the ledges below him, and was trying
to ascend the steep side of the chasm. She had a
rope, which she had flung up, with its noose hooked
over a projection.</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” she cried confidently, and began to
climb the rope.</p>

<p>Her slight body swung and swayed over the dizzy
chasm as she began to climb. Slowly ascending, sometimes
she slipped back, with a motion that made him
think she was falling and brought his heart into his
mouth.</p>

<p>He did not clearly see her face now, and he had
not secured a very good view of it, but he felt sure
he knew who the young woman was.</p>

<p>With much difficulty, the girl climbed the rope and
drew herself upon the ledge to which the noose held.
She looked up, and then he saw her face clearly&mdash;the
face of Lena Forest. Yet it seemed impossible she
could be there, as he had believed she was safe at the
fort.</p>

<p>While the plucky girl was thus climbing the face of
the dizzy precipice, the fire was raging with wild fury,
as if it knew that help was coming to the scout and it
was determined to overwhelm him before that help
could arrive. The increasing heat almost blistered his
face and hands now, and it drove him to the very edge
of the precipice, over which he soon was hanging, to
escape it.</p>

<p>With a heroism that was beyond praise, Lena continued
to mount, from ledge to ledge, throwing up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
rope and catching it on projections, and then climbing
up to the projections. At length she gained the
ledge below the scout.</p>

<p>When she looked up now he saw that she was on the
point of exhaustion. Her face was pale, and her eyes
were big and bright. Her breath came in gasps, as
she stood up for the last cast of the rope.</p>

<p>“Catch it!” she said, then the rope shot from her
hand, and the noose was caught by the scout.</p>

<p>With a turn, he looped the noose over a point of
the rock by him, and the next instant he was sliding
down the rope. It was like a rescue from the very
jaws of death.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill gained the ledge, he found Lena
Forest lying there, almost in a faint, from sheer exhaustion
and intense excitement.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, I was in time!” she said, in a
tremulous voice, when she saw he had reached the
ledge.</p>

<p>“Yes!” he echoed. “I can never thank you enough
for that. It saved me from an awful fate, though
we’re not entirely secure here.”</p>

<p>“No, but you’re safe from the fire.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>He looked down at the ledges still below him. The
noose of the rope was on the rock point above, and
he had no rope now with which to make a further
descent. How he was ever to get down into the cañon
without a rope he did not know.</p>

<p>“We’ll hope the fire won’t trouble the noose up
there,” he said to her; “and, if it doesn’t, when the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
dies down we can climb up the rope and get out above.
It seems impossible to descend into the cañon.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me I can never climb another yard,”
Lena declared, so thoroughly fatigued that she was
almost crying.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE GIRL AND THE EMERALDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The fire roared on the pine levels overhead, and the
girl and the scout whom she had rescued from the
fire talked.</p>

<p>They had much to talk about beyond the fact that
she had saved the scout, and the inevitable discussion
as to how they were to get off the ledge where they
now were.</p>

<p>“Lena,” he said finally, and his tone showed hesitation,
“I suppose you are strong enough to hear unpleasant
news?”</p>

<p>Her face, already pale, grew paler.</p>

<p>“My uncle?” she gasped. “Something has happened
to him!”</p>

<p>The scout put his hand into an inner pocket and
brought out a filled buckskin bag.</p>

<p>“He asked me to send, or get, this to you.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, trembling.</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he is not dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lena,” said the kind-hearted scout, his own
voice shaking. “I am sorry to have to tell you that
he died two days ago. You know he was not well
when he last saw your father. I’ve been doing some
scouting work in the mountains. Thinking to visit
him, I called at the cabin, and found him seriously
ill with fever, in fact, at the point of death. I did
all I could for him, but it was little enough, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
died. He gave me this package to give to you, or
send to you; for he thought you had started for the
East long ago. He thought you would persuade your
father to give up his mine and go home&mdash;he had never
heard of John Forest’s death.”</p>

<p>He put the buckskin bag in her trembling hands.</p>

<p>When she opened it she found it filled with what
seemed to be bits of broken green glass.</p>

<p>“Emeralds, and as fine as you’ll ever see,” he explained.
“There’s a fortune there, and he wanted me
to see that they went to you. It’s a queer place here
to deliver them, and a strange&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped, for she was not looking at the emeralds;
thinking of her father, she had begun to weep.</p>

<p>“There was no letter from my uncle?” she said
after a while.</p>

<p>“No; he was too weak to write. He sent his love
and the emeralds. He was looking for gold, you
know. Well, his pick broke through into a cave, and
opened up a queer place that must once have been
an Indian temple, or medicine lodge. The emeralds
had been round the neck of a stone idol. The buckskin
string that had held them was decayed, so that they
had fallen to the floor, and were covered with dust.
He found one, and then, by a search, got all of them.</p>

<p>“His first thought was that perhaps there were
many more, and he made a thorough search. I’m
afraid that in that search he got the fever that killed
him. The place was horridly damp, as I afterward
found; for, after his death, I myself made a thorough
exploration of the cave, and discovered that fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
though nothing else. The only gems were round the
neck of the idol, I am sure.”</p>

<p>She heard him with heartbreaking interest.</p>

<p>“I must think about it,” she said; “I must have time
to adjust myself to it. It seems unbelievable. Oh,
my poor uncle!”</p>

<p>She seemed almost to have forgotten her strange
position on that ledge, the rescue of the scout, and the
roaring of the fire above.</p>

<p>For a long time she sat crouching, regaining her
strength, while she thought over the sad thing which
had thus been brought to her knowledge, and went
back in memory to the past.</p>

<p>For two years she had lived in the mining cabin not
far from this cañon with her father. In many ways
those two years had been hard ones for both her and
her father. They had been lonely years to her, for
he had been away from home a good deal, and his
brother, now dead also, had visited them very seldom.</p>

<p>But the loneliness had recently been broken by the
visits of the young man, to whom she had almost from
the first given her heart. Clayton was at Crystal
Spring, where he intended to make a home for her, and
he was to have met her and accompanied her on her
way back to the fort, but she had missed him, and so
had come alone.</p>

<p>The morning after her return she had seen the fire,
and then had discovered that Buffalo Bill, the friend of
her lover, was in peril on the high precipice.</p>

<p>As she sat in silence on the ledge, grieving over the
death of her uncle, she paid scant attention to the beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
emeralds lying in her lap; but finally she looked
down at them, slowly placed them in the buckskin bag,
and then gave it to the scout.</p>

<p>“Keep them for me a while, until we get out of this
danger,” she requested. “I wonder how we are to get
out, too?” She looked up at the smoke floating over
them in a thick cloud. “Have you thought of any
way?”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, while watching the changing face of
the girl, had also been looking at the rope at intervals,
fearing the noose would be burned away above. That
had not yet happened, and the fire was dying down.
There was a great deal of smoke, yet little fire.</p>

<p>He took the buckskin bag of emeralds and restored
it to his pocket.</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to see how that fire is doing,” he
said, rising to his feet. He began to climb the rope,
and was soon at the top.</p>

<p>There was still a good deal of fire in the woods beyond,
where some trees were burning, but close by the
rocky point there was hardly any blaze now, and the
noose of the rope had been untouched.</p>

<p>He leaned over and looked down at the girl.</p>

<p>“It’s cool enough for one to stand it up here now,”
he called to her. “If you’d like to come up, make a
noose and put it under your arms.”</p>

<p>She made and adjusted the noose, and the strong
arms of the scout soon drew her to the top of the
precipitous wall.</p>

<p>“Not very pleasant up here even yet,” he said, “but
better than down there; and we have the comforting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
assurance that we’re out of the cañon, and that the
rope was equal to the strain.”</p>

<p>“If we keep close to the cañon’s edge, perhaps we
can get beyond the fire now,” she suggested. “You
have a horse, you said.”</p>

<p>“If the poor fellow hasn’t been roasted. I’m a bit
afraid the fire reached him.”</p>

<p>They set out along the edge of the precipice, Buffalo
Bill taking the rope.</p>

<p>Though the ground was still hot and smoking in
places, they were able to make their way along, and,
after a while, they passed out of the burned area, and
came into a region which the fire had not touched.</p>

<p>“There the clever rascal is,” said the scout. “Look
at him!&mdash;as peaceful as a lamb!”</p>

<p>His horse had broken the rope by which it had been
tied, had run from the fire, and was now grazing
peacefully, not a hundred yards from where the scout
and the girl stood.</p>

<p>The girl had asked many questions about her uncle,
about his illness, and about the emeralds; but she began
to talk of these matters again, when they got beyond
the burned area, showing that she had thought of nothing
else all the time, even when she seemed to be thinking
only of getting away from the fire.</p>

<p>The scout went over the story again, giving all the
details, until, by the aid of her imagination, Lena was
able to reconstruct the whole thing.</p>

<p>“About those emeralds,” she said. “What am I to
do with them?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you please. It was your uncle’s desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
for you to have them, so that you might be freed from
all want, educate yourself to whatever extent you desired,
travel, and enjoy life. It was a satisfaction to
him to believe that you would get them, and that they
would make you independent. I promised him faithfully
that I would deliver them into your hands; and
if you hadn’t happened back here as you did, and I
had escaped from that fire, it was my intention to return
immediately to the fort for the purpose of delivering
them to you personally.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” she said. “You wouldn’t trust
them to the express or to the stages?”</p>

<p>“I should not have felt it safe to do so.”</p>

<p>“The country is full of road agents.”</p>

<p>“Yes; robbers and outlaws of all kinds.”</p>

<p>She seemed to be thinking of this as they walked on
toward the scout’s horse.</p>

<p>The animal was caught by Buffalo Bill, and he then
insisted that she should ride and that he would walk.
He accompanied her to her uncle’s cabin home, which
was not far away. It was situated near the stage trail
that ran from Glendive to the railroad.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE EAVESDROPPER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As Buffalo Bill and Lena Forest approached her
uncle’s home, a man who had been in the cabin slipped
out by the back door.</p>

<p>His horse was hidden in the grove two hundred
yards off, and at first he thought of reaching it and
riding hurriedly away. But he hesitated; and then,
seeing an opening, he crawled under the floor.</p>

<p>“I’ll just hear what that scout and the girl aire talkin’
about,” he said. “And I’d like to know about them
emeralds, if he or she has got ’em. He was to have
given ’em to her. But I’m gamblin’ he ain’t any honester
than other folks, and that he ain’t said a word
to her about ’em. I’ve got to git my fist on ’em, er
know why. Great howlin’ tomcats! Them gems aire
worth a fortune that would make these hyer little common
fortunes you hear about look sick. I’m bettin’
Buffalo Bill never hints a word to her about ’em. He’d
be a fool to, and he ain’t a fool!”</p>

<p>He was hiding under the floor when Buffalo Bill
and the girl came to the cabin and entered it. To his
surprise, they were speaking of the emeralds which he
had been sure the scout would never mention to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s got ’em now, has she?” he thought, as he
heard the talk. He pressed an ear to the boards above
his head. “Oh, ho! He thinks there’s danger that
some one will git onto the fact that she’s got ’em, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
that she’s in danger with ’em in this section of the
country. I reckon he don’t dream that I’m already
onto the fact that there aire such gems; that I came
on him when he was givin’ his promise to old Gordon
there in the mountains, and that I follered him, hopin’
to git a chance to pinch ’em; and that I fired the pines,
believin’ that I could roast him, and afterward git
them emeralds from his dead body. Well, I ain’t got
’em yit, but I’ll have ’em!”</p>

<p>Though he so desired those emeralds, all his efforts
to get them had been sneaking and cowardly in the
extreme.</p>

<p>“I’ll have Bruce go with me, and I’ll let him carry
them,” he heard Lena say. “I’m going East, Mr.
Cody, for a little visit, and perhaps Bruce can go
part way with me, on the stage.”</p>

<p>“Bruce! Bruce!” the rascal muttered. “Who’s
Bruce? So he’s to carry ’em, is he? He’s sweet on
the girl. I’ve heard that she has a ‘steady,’ and that
they’re going to marry. She’ll have him go with her,
and she’ll have him carry the emeralds, for no one will
ever think of him carryin’ ’em. That’s the game, is it?
Oh, no; nobody will ever think of that!”</p>

<p>The listening rascal slapped his leg so hard in his
jubilant mood that he became startled; the sound of
talking ceased. He heard the scout walk to the door,
and then walk back.</p>

<p>“That was my horse, I guess, made that noise,” he
heard the scout say.</p>

<p>The man crouched into as small a space as he could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
and lay shivering, fearing now to breathe. Soon he
heard the talking going on again.</p>

<p>“Oh! Aha!” he muttered, listening. “She’s goin’
to take the next stage, which comes through here day
after to-morrow, and go on that, and her young man
is to go with her. I reckon that when they git East
they’ll marry. He’ll be a fool not to marry her, if
they git through with the emeralds. But I reckon
them gems aire due in this direction; and, somehow, I
think I’ll git ’em!”</p>

<p>When he had heard apparently all that was to be
said concerning the emeralds and the manner of their
transmission to the East, he crawled from under the
house.</p>

<p>He was standing under a tree, beyond the corner of
the house, when he was surprised there by Buffalo Bill,
who came on him suddenly, the scout having issued
from the front door.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the scout gruffly. “What are you
doing here?”</p>

<p>Instead of answering, the man turned about and
ran.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill drew a revolver; then lowered it. He
did not want to shoot the fellow, nor did he want to
alarm the girl.</p>

<p>“The rascal was slipping up to the house for some
purpose,” he said, “but he didn’t reach it. I came out
and caught him here under the tree. Some scoundrelly
scamp who thought to do a little stealing! If I tell
Miss Forest it will only frighten her. And her nerves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
are gone all to pieces now. What’s the use of worrying
her further?”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill watched the man as he disappeared
within the grove, and saw him come out with his horse
and ride off.</p>

<p>“The villain tried to keep his face turned away so
that I wouldn’t know him next time I saw him, but I
think I’d recognize him, just the same!”</p>

<p>He returned to the house, and discovered Lena contemplating
the emeralds, which she had poured out on
the table.</p>

<p>“Good thing he didn’t get to see them,” was the
scout’s thought, when he observed that.</p>

<p>“It seems almost as if my uncle <em>must</em> come again,
and that I ought to wait here for him,” she said,
looking up. “It’s strange how I can’t make myself
realize that he is dead.”</p>

<p>She rested her cheek on her hand and looked at the
scout. She was a handsome girl, clad simply, but in
good taste, and he could note her beauty. Her brown
eyes were dark and dreamy, and the flush now in her
cheeks, though it was a bit hectic, gave them the color
that they needed. The hand on which she rested her
cheek was small and shapely, though it was now rope-burned
and red from the effects of her climb that morning
to save the life of the scout.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to realize a thing which one doesn’t see,”
Buffalo Bill assented.</p>

<p>“Of course, I can’t stay here,” she said; “and, really,
I must go at once; for hereafter this house will seem
haunted to me. I’ll go straight East, and have Bruce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
go with me. I may never come back again. And
yet I should like to look just once on my father’s
grave.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lonely place,” he said. “We heaped a cairn
of stones over it, and set up a little wooden headboard,
bearing his name and the date of his death.”</p>

<p>“I shall put a costly monument there some time,”
she announced.</p>

<p>“He was worthy of it; for he was a good man, and
I’m sure his last thoughts were of you.”</p>

<p>The brown eyes dimmed again with tears.</p>

<p>She placed the emeralds in the buckskin bag, stowed
it in the bosom of her dress, and walked to the door.
Standing there, she glanced longingly up the trail and
out across the river, to the side of the cañon she had
scaled, and then let her eyes wander on to the smoking
pines that stood in blackened ranks still higher.</p>

<p>“I’m expecting every minute that Bruce will come,”
she said. “Something is keeping him.” She sat
down again by the table. “Let me get you some breakfast,”
she urged; “and pardon me for not thinking of
it before.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been too busy to think of anything to eat, my
dear girl. Does Bruce know you are here?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I left word for him that I was going to see my
uncle, and told him how to get here. But I’m neglecting
you! I have been too much excited. I’ll get
you something. And that will help to pass the time
away, too.”</p>

<p>She was soon busy in the little kitchen.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was thinking of the man he had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
under the tree. “I wonder if he could have been
nearer the house than that?” he began now to question,
as he left the house again and walked out to the
tree.</p>

<p>He began to scan the ground between the house and
the tree. The color rose in his face as he did so, for he
saw that the man had been at the door and close by the
windows; also he saw the hole under the house, which
looked as if something had lately passed through it.</p>

<p>“Have you a dog?” he asked, returning to the house.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “Uncle never kept a dog, though
often I’ve though he ought to have one, and a good,
savage one, too, living out here alone so much. But
no one ever really troubled him. Several months ago
a drunken man came along the trail, and at another
time an Indian tried to get into the house to steal
something; but that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That was enough!”</p>

<p>She was bustling about the kitchen, and soon she
had the breakfast ready, and they sat down to it.</p>

<p>“You’re expecting some one, too?” she said. “Pawnee
Bill, and who was the other?”</p>

<p>“Nick Nomad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; such an odd name I couldn’t remember it.
And you say he is an odd character?”</p>

<p>“But with a heart of gold. Old Nick Nomad is
as true and good a friend as I ever could wish to
have.”</p>

<p>“And all three of you are here looking for Blackfeet
Indians and road agents?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span></p>

<p>“I should think that would be dangerous?”</p>

<p>“It has its drawbacks&mdash;a hunter of road agents may
get a bullet from one of them at any time.”</p>

<p>He said it lightly, yet he meant it; the calling was
peculiarly dangerous. He preferred other work, and
even scouting for Indians in a hostile Indian country
he considered far less perilous.</p>

<p>When the breakfast was ended, she went to the door
again and looked up and down the trail.</p>

<p>“Your friends are coming!” she announced.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill stepped quickly to the door.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill and Nick Nomad were approaching on
horseback, from the direction of Glendive, a town situated
beyond Crystal Spring.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MUSTANG CATCHERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Bruce Clayton, the lover and promised husband of
pretty Lena Forest, appeared at the cabin while Pawnee
Bill and Nomad were greeting the famous scout.</p>

<p>Her face flushed prettily as Buffalo Bill spoke in
praise of her heroic work in rescuing him from the
fire. But it flushed even more, with a glow of love
and joy, when Bruce appeared. He had not known of
the death of the girl’s uncle, and was shocked by the
news; but he declared his entire willingness to accompany
her in the stage to the railroad station, and on
East, if she wished it. There could be no doubt that
such a journey with the girl he loved would be the
supreme pleasure of his life.</p>

<p>Nomad drew Buffalo Bill aside at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” he said, “we seen a feller hikin’ toward
ther hills fast as his hoss could go, and he comed
from this direction; seemed ter me he was scai’t about
somethin’ er ’nother.”</p>

<p>The old trapper had seen the man who had fled from
the cabin&mdash;the eavesdropper whom Buffalo Bill had
surprised beneath the tree.</p>

<p>While they talked, Pawnee Bill joined them. He
was the same gallant, debonair, handsome scout,
dressed with an attention to appearance that marked
him among the careless bordermen&mdash;his velvet jacket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
his gold-mounted revolvers, and the costly saddle that
was on the back of his horse, always drawing attention
wherever he went.</p>

<p>“What, ho!” he said gayly, as he joined the scout
and the trapper. “Cody, we’d found a band of mustangers,
and we half think they are mixed up in some
way with this stage-robbery business that’s making
the land hereabout notorious. I think we’d better investigate
them a bit.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill mentioned the man he had seen, and
who had been sighted by Nomad.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; he was riding as if the Old Boy was
after him.” Pawnee Bill laughed at the recollection.
“He was going so fast that he was only hitting the
high places. And, come to think of it, he was heading
in the direction of the valley where those mustangers
hang out at present.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill told him what he suspected, told him of
the death of the girl’s uncle, and of the valuable emeralds
with which he had been intrusted.</p>

<p>“She’d better get out of here with them as quick
as she can,” said Pawnee Bill. “The knowledge of
such things can’t be kept; and if she isn’t held up and
robbed of them, it will be because she moves out in
a hurry.”</p>

<p>After discussing the matter with these friends, the
scout had another talk with Lena, speaking also to
young Clayton; and it was arranged that she and
Bruce should go that day to Glendive, and there take
the next stage for the railroad, thus getting out of
the country with the emeralds as soon as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span></p>

<p>Shortly after this talk, Buffalo Bill rode away with
his two pards, disappearing from sight of the cabin,
and journeying in the direction of the camp of the
mustangers.</p>

<p>When they reached the valley where the mustangers
were, they found that a mustang drive was in progress.</p>

<p>“This looks honest,” said Buffalo Bill. “Men who
make a business of robbery and road-agent work aren’t
going to fool with catching wild horses; they can make
more money in the other line.”</p>

<p>He and his friends looked about for the man who
had been seen by him at the cabin, but failed to find
him.</p>

<p>The “boss” of the mustangers was a dark-skinned
fellow known as Black John; a man of herculean build,
whose great size did not hamper his movements, for he
was light on his feet and as quick of motion as any
man that followed him.</p>

<p>An extended semicircle of mustangers was closing
in on a band of wild horses. Few words were spoken.
Each man understood his duty, and was doing it.</p>

<p>The three pards rode close up to the line of mustangers
and looked on with interest.</p>

<p>In the old days, the plains and foothills held many
bands of mustangs, or wild horses, small, hardy animals,
of great speed and endurance, and their capture
in large numbers was a paying occupation. In some
sections of the great West there are still considerable
bodies of mustangs, but no such bands as once existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span></p>

<p>The method of catching these wild horses required
great patience and persistence. They were not lassoed,
after being run down in a hot race, as many people
suppose; they were too fleet for that. The common
method adopted was to walk them down. For days,
and even weeks, the mustangers would follow slowly
a band of wild horses. Always the mustangs held
pretty close to a certain grazing ground to which they
were accustomed, and if driven away from it, they
invariably came back to it. Usually once a day they
sought some river or water hole to drink.</p>

<p>Knowing their habits, the mustangers would drive
toward a band and start the animals to moving. At
first the wild horses would dash away, running in
fright. The mustangers did not pursue rapidly, but
kept their horses at a slow pace. The object was to
keep the animals continually moving. The first day
or so the mustangs would run a great deal and tire
themselves.</p>

<p>The mustangers prevented them from stopping long
enough to feed, and herded them away from the customary
watering place. At the end of a week the
mustangs began to show signs of exhaustion. Eventually,
thirst, starvation, and fatigue would do their
work, when the horses could be driven in any direction.</p>

<p>When this much had been accomplished, nooses
were concealed in the grass, with men hidden by them.
The mustangs were driven over these nooses, which
were jerked, securing the mustangs by the legs. One
by one they were thus trapped, being driven time after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
time over the hidden nooses, until all fell victims to
the cunning of the mustangers.</p>

<p>There were two hundred mustangs or more being
driven that day upon the nooses concealed in the grass
along the little stream where the mustangers had their
camp; and Buffalo Bill and his friends, sitting their
horses near by, watched with interest the work of the
capture of these wild horses.</p>

<p>When a mustang was captured, a short chain was
affixed to one foreleg, and he was then released. He
could not run; when he tried it he invariably stepped on
the chain with one of his hind feet and either threw
himself or gave himself such a wrench that he soon
gave up trying. Besides, the mustangs were now too
tired to make much effort to get away.</p>

<p>When all had been captured they were to be driven
into a high-fenced corral, and left to recuperate; after
which there would be exciting times in “breaking”
them, when such stunts of wild riding and bucking
would be seen as could probably be witnessed nowhere
else.</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty of the mustangs that were being
crowded upon the hidden nooses broke away, and made
a dash to escape.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his companions were near the point
where they broke out, and started in pursuit of them.</p>

<p>One of them, a handsome fellow, separated from the
others; Pawnee Bill, whirling his lariat, started in
chase.</p>

<p>The lariat flew out, and its noose circled the head of
the mustang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span></p>

<p>But the horse ridden by Pawnee Bill set its foot in
a dog hole, and fell, throwing the dead shot to the
ground. At the same instant, the jerk on the lariat
tore it from the saddle. As it flew out it became
wrapped round the body of the fallen rider, dragging
him across the plain.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill shouted, and rode to the help of his
friend, driving his horse at its highest speed.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill, caught in the lariat and dragged by the
frightened mustang, would have been dragged to his
death if Buffalo Bill had not ridden quickly to his
rescue.</p>

<p>Leaning from his saddle, Buffalo Bill slashed the
rope with his knife; and the mustang raced on, leaving
Pawnee Bill on the ground, somewhat crestfallen
and bruised, but practically unhurt. He sprang up,
and ran to get his horse, which had got its foot out
of the dog hole, and seemed to be uninjured.</p>

<p>“Cody, yours forever!” he shouted. “I’ll come to
your aid likewise and also whenever you get into
trouble like that.”</p>

<p>Then he was in the saddle, chasing the running mustang,
which was dragging the severed end of the rope.
He succeeded in riding around it, and drove it back
toward the herd, where Buffalo Bill noosed it, and it
was subdued.</p>

<p>“Great work, Cody!” called Black John, the leader
of the mustangers. “That is your mustang, if you
want him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you a present of him, so far as my interest
goes,” said Buffalo Bill. “It seems a pity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
though, that such a fine fellow has to be subdued and
turned into a work animal.”</p>

<p>“True enough, Cody; but we men have to work, and
why not horses? He’ll never do enough work to
harm him, in my judgment. I get twenty dollars
apiece for these, after they’re a bit broken, and there’s
some money in it.”</p>

<p>A man was galloping across the valley.</p>

<p>“Some one is coming,” said the scout, drawing Black
John’s attention to the horseman. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>Black John looked at the man.</p>

<p>“That’s Toby Sam,” he said; “one of my men.”</p>

<p>“Why Toby Sam?” said the scout.</p>

<p>“Just the name we call him by, that’s all; I dunno
what his real name is.”</p>

<p>Toby Sam was the rascal who had been under the
tree at Gordon’s and had fled when spoken to by Buffalo
Bill. He was one of the mustangers! It was a
fact so suspicious that the scout decided to watch the
mustang catchers a while longer, and to find out more
about Toby Sam.</p>

<p>When Toby Sam arrived, and discovered that Buffalo
Bill and his friends were there, he showed much
confusion, but tried to cover it up.</p>

<p>Old Nick Nomad rode up to him.</p>

<p>“Stranger,” he said bluntly, “I’m glad ter know ye,
but I has seen yer before, when you was ridin’ at sech
a lickety-clip toward this valley, from the direction of
Gordon’s cabin, over on ther stage trail. Thet war
this mornin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span></p>

<p>“You’re mistaken,” said Toby Sam. “I wasn’t over
there this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“You were not at Forest’s this morning?” said Buffalo
Bill, his sharp eyes boring Toby Sam. “Didn’t
I see you under the tree there close by the house;
and, when I spoke to you, didn’t you run and get your
horse, and ride away without answering me?”</p>

<p>“It’s a mistake,” said Toby Sam. “I wasn’t over
there at all.”</p>

<p>“Then I beg your pardon,” said the scout. “It was
a mistake.”</p>

<p>But he knew that Toby Sam had lied, and he wondered
why.</p>

<p>In connection with the fact that Toby Sam might
have seen those emeralds, or heard talk about them, it
was so suggestive that the scout became uneasy.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE ATTACK ON THE STAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After tarrying with the mustang catchers of the Bitter
Water, and trying to study Toby Sam, Black John,
and others, Buffalo Bill and his friends departed, with
no very clear conclusions, except a deepening suspicion
against Toby Sam.</p>

<p>They journeyed toward the stage trail, thinking to
intersect it where the stage would pass, and there get
a final word with Lena Forest, who was to take the
stage that day to the railroad.</p>

<p>As they approached the crossing, they heard what
was undoubtedly an attack on the stagecoach.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his companions rode rapidly toward
the shots and the tumult.</p>

<p>When they reached the trail they saw only a woman
running about in distraction. The stage and the outlaws
were gone. The woman was Lena Forest.</p>

<p>“The robbers have taken her emeralds!” was the
conclusion of Buffalo Bill, as he dashed up to her, with
Pawnee Bill and Nomad at his heels.</p>

<p>She stared at him wild-eyed, and then rushed to
meet him.</p>

<p>“Bruce!” she cried. “They have carried him away.”</p>

<p>It was not the gems she thought of, but her lover.</p>

<p>“And the emeralds?” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“They are here,” she said. “I concluded to carry
them myself. The stage was attacked right here by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
masked men. They took my watch and purse, but
didn’t know of the emeralds; but they carried away
Bruce! He must be&mdash;be followed at once.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill slipped out of the saddle.</p>

<p>“Where are the other passengers?” he said. “What
became of them?”</p>

<p>“They went on in the stage, after the holdup. The
driver whipped up his horses and drove on; but I threw
open the coach door and leaped out. I couldn’t go
on, for Bruce had been seized and carried away by
the road agents. I wanted to do something to help
him; but when I got back here the road agents were
gone. They seemed in a great hurry, and did their
work quickly.”</p>

<p>“Did you get a look at the face of any one of them?”
Pawnee Bill asked.</p>

<p>“They were masked.”</p>

<p>“What kind of horses did they ride?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; Indian ponies, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“And they went south?”</p>

<p>“Yes; toward the mountains.”</p>

<p>Lena declared her belief that the road agents had
taken young Clayton because they had received word
in some manner of the emeralds, and believed he was
carrying them.</p>

<p>“When they discover their mistake,” she said, “they
may kill him!” She looked appealingly at Buffalo
Bill. “I risked my life to save you from the fire, Mr.
Cody,” she reminded; “and now I ask in return that
you help me to rescue Bruce from the hands of those
men, if it can be done. It must be done, if he is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
slain by them at once, or as soon as they find he hasn’t
the emeralds.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was ready to give her the promise asked.</p>

<p>“One of us will go with you to the railroad, or back
to Glendive,” he said; “and the others will follow the
outlaws as fast as possible.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she cried. “I am going with you!”</p>

<p>Altogether, it seemed to him that the situation was
unique. The outlaws had attacked the stage to get possession
of the emeralds. Not finding them, and believing
that young Clayton had them, they were carrying
him away, and had gone in great haste. And now the
girl who really carried on her person the coveted gems
was urging a pursuit of the road agents, and declaring
her intention of taking part in it.</p>

<p>“We have no horse for you,” he said, to dissuade
her. “Besides, we need a larger force, for there will
probably be a fight. If one of us conducts you to
Glendive, or the railroad, he could summon help.”</p>

<p>“The delay will be too great,” she urged. “Those
men ought to be followed at once, and we can’t weaken
your force by sending a man away. Some chance may
come to help Bruce. And I must go with you.” She
looked at the scout’s horse. “Your horse will carry
double, I think; and you’ll find me a good horsewoman.
I can mount behind you.”</p>

<p>It was a waste of time to protest against the wishes
of such a woman. Moreover, Buffalo Bill admired her
pluck and high courage, and he knew she would be
no weakling. The woman who could climb a wall of
that perilous cañon and hurl a rope to him, as she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
done, had more than the usual share of coolness and
daring. In short, he recognized in this brown-haired,
bright-faced young woman the stuff of which heroines
are made.</p>

<p>“The emeralds!” he said, as a final objection.</p>

<p>“Let them go! I’d give them to the road agents
willingly if they would release Bruce. And, Mr.
Cody, I confess to you that is what I mean to do if I
get the chance&mdash;offer the gems to those men for
Bruce’s release. We can’t fight them, they’re too
strong; but we might buy them, if we can get in touch
with them to enter into negotiations. That’s what I
hope to do. They want the emeralds, not Bruce.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” he admitted. “I think they want the
emeralds much more than they do him.”</p>

<p>“What I can’t understand is, how they knew I had
them, or anything about them. But they did. They
searched Bruce hurriedly; and I heard one of them tell
him to hand over the emeralds. Where did they find
out about them?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make a confession to you,” said Buffalo Bill,
“as we ride along. Lucky this horse is big and strong,
and doesn’t object to double burdens!” he cried, as he
helped her to mount to the back of his horse, and then
he swung up into the saddle.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill and Nomad started their horses, and
turned into the broad trail left by the road agents when
they rode away with their prisoner.</p>

<p>“The confession I make is,” said Buffalo Bill, “that
a man who, I believe, was in this stage holdup, was
seen by me at your uncle’s home when I was there&mdash;when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
I came there with the emeralds, after the fire. I
didn’t want to tell you before, and make you uneasy.
But I saw him out under the tree, and when I tried to
speak with him he ran. I have been thinking the matter
over since, and am pretty sure now that he listened
at the window, or under the floor.”</p>

<p>“Under the floor?”</p>

<p>“You’ll remember that I asked you if your uncle
kept a dog? That was because I had seen a hole under
the floor which appeared as if something&mdash;some animal
or man&mdash;had recently been in it. I think now that the
man I’m speaking of had really been under the floor.
If so, he probably heard our talk about the emeralds.</p>

<p>“Now, another thing: That man my friends and I
saw with the mustang catchers of the Bitter Water.
He is called Toby Sam.”</p>

<p>“You think the mustang catchers had a hand in this
holdup?”</p>

<p>“It looks it. I’m guessing a good deal, you see, and
really am in the dark; but that is my present guess.”</p>

<p>The horses were going at a gallop now.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill drew rein, and asked the others to stop.</p>

<p>“We’re foolish,” he said, “to take those emeralds on
with us. The thing to do is to hide them here somewhere.
Then, no matter what happens, they will be
safe.”</p>

<p>“But I intend to offer them for the release of my
dear Bruce,” she objected.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be right to the memory of your uncle,”
said the scout. “He gave you those emeralds for a
certain purpose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, to make my life happy; but it can never be
happy if Bruce should be killed, especially if I had the
feeling that I was to blame because I held back the
emeralds.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Buffalo Bill, Pawnee Bill, and Nomad
talked her out of the notion of attempting to make this
sacrifice of the gems.</p>

<p>“You are wiser than I,” she said, in submitting.
“Do with them as you like.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, they concealed the emeralds in the
buckskin bag at the foot of a small tree, whose location
it would be easy to remember. Then they went
on with the girl, following in the road agents’ trail, and
discussing the question of whether Pawnee Bill had not
better ride to Glendive for assistance.</p>

<p>Hardly were they out of sight of the tree where they
had buried the gems when Black John, the leader of
the mustang catchers, came out of some bushes not far
off, and advanced into the open, leading his horse.</p>

<p>“Now, what in thunder did they bury there?” he was
saying. “I’ll jes’ take a look, and see!”</p>

<p>He found the place where the emeralds had been hid,
and unearthed them.</p>

<p>“Great Rocky Mountains!” he gasped, when he
opened the buckskin bag and saw the priceless emeralds
that lay in it. “But all the fiends’ luck, if this ain’t
a funny deal! Here we planned to rob the stage and
git the emeralds that Toby Sam tole us about. He
said that the young feller was to carry ’em, for safety.
I was late gittin’ here; and before I could do more’n
hide they had gone for the stage, and was kitin’ out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
south with the young feller a prisoner. And now here
comes along Buffalo Bill and his crowd, with the
young lady, and before goin’ furder they buries the
jewels here, fer me! Waugh! I’ve heard of mericles,
and this is one of ’em!”</p>

<p>He held up the gems and let them slide through his
greedy fingers.</p>

<p>“Luck&mdash;luck, such luck!” he muttered. “I’m wadin’
in luck, I’m swimmin’ in it. I’m jes’ natcherly wallerin’
in luck! Hoop-la! Emeralds fer a king! And now
they’re right here in my fist.”</p>

<p>Craft and greediness came to him.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s seen me; the boys has gone on with
Stockton; and here I’ve got the emeralds. Nobody’s
seen me!” He looked all around, and saw not a person
anywhere. “By the great tarantulas, why should
I divide ’em with the other fellers? Why should I?
We expected to git holt of ’em, and divide ’em up, and
it would have been a handsome haul fer each of us,
even then. Toby Sam put us onto it because he was
too durn cowardly to try to make the riffle himself.
But now&mdash;now they’re mine! Why shouldn’t I hold
’em, and say nothin’? But durn ef I don’t, too!”</p>

<p>He stowed the buckskin bag of emeralds somewhere
in an inner pocket of his coat. Then he mounted his
horse and rode slowly in the direction taken by the
road agents, and by the men and the girl who had
pursued them.</p>

<p>“Luck!” he was muttering. “I’m swimmin’, I’m
wallerin’, in luck. Was there ever sech luck in the
world before? I don’t believe it. Hope to Harry I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
won’t wake up and find that I’m jes’ dreamin’; that
I ain’t here, and there ain’t been no holdup; and that
there ain’t any emeralds at all! Oh, gosh all fiddlesticks,
wouldn’t that make me sweat! Surely I can’t
be dreamin’! Lemme take another look at ’em, to be
certain.”</p>

<p>He took another look, and was sure that he was
wide awake, and that the emeralds were really in his
possession.</p>

<p>“Luck!” he cried. “Hoop-la! I’m rollin’ in the
biggest luck I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>Then he rode on, jubilant and excited beyond words
to express.</p>

<span class="fs70">DISAPPOINTED ROAD AGENTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Black John had not come in time to lead the gang in
the attack on the stage. In his absence, Toby Sam
was the leader; and the fact that Toby Sam was the
leader accounted in large measure for the precipitate
haste of the men engaged in the holdup.</p>

<p>They were in such a hurry that they did no very
thorough job. When they could not find the emeralds
on Clayton, they simply bundled him on a horse and
rode off with him, sure he had them concealed in his
clothing, and that they could search him at their leisure,
where there was no danger of rifle bullets.</p>

<p>Toby Sam was a coward. That was the explanation
of this singular action. Like leader, like man; all were
cowards when he led them.</p>

<p>When they had ridden at a sharp gallop for a couple
of miles, they stopped their headlong pace and crowded
around the prisoner, whose feet were tied under his
horse’s belly, and whose hands were tied behind his
back.</p>

<p>Toby Sam flashed a glittering revolver and pointed
it at him.</p>

<p>“Cough up, now!” he commanded. “We ain’t got
no time to fool with you. We want them emeralds
you’re carryin’, and we’re goin’ to have ’em. If you
don’t fork ’em out, er tell us where to find ’em quick,
we’ll tear the clothes off of ye, and cut you into ribbons.
Understand, we’re goin’ to have ’em!”</p>

<p>Bruce Clayton smiled disdainfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p>“I haven’t got them,” he said.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’ll say you don’t know anything about
’em?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t say that, since you seem to know
better; but I haven’t got them.”</p>

<p>“You did have them!”</p>

<p>“Not on this stage trip.”</p>

<p>“No? Do you mean it?” Toby Sam howled the
words, and his comrades crowded angrily round the
young man. “Who had ’em, then?”</p>

<p>“When I get ready, I’ll tell you that,” Bruce said
coolly. “You know so much, I shouldn’t think you’d
need to ask me anything.”</p>

<p>“Search him!” yelled Toby Sam.</p>

<p>Some of the road agents threw themselves on their
helpless prisoner and searched him thoroughly, doing
it in the roughest fashion. However, they failed to
find the emeralds.</p>

<p>“He ain’t got ’em!” they yelled.</p>

<p>Toby Sam threw up his revolver again. He was
brave enough when his enemy was tied, and could not
possibly harm him.</p>

<p>“Tell us where them em’rulds aire!” he ordered.
“And do it mighty quick, er you’ll do no more talkin’
in this world.”</p>

<p>There was such menace in his words and tone that
Bruce hesitated.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” he said, “if you’ll let me go.”</p>

<p>“Boyees, you hear him?” said Toby Sam.</p>

<p>“After ther boss comes, we’ll let him go, if he tells
the truth,” said one of the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, after the boss comes!” others shouted.</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows,” said the young man coolly,
“couldn’t you just whisk those masks aside, so that I
can see your faces? I always like to know who I’m
talking with. Strikes me this is a one-sided affair;
you know me, but hanged if I do you.”</p>

<p>“But you’d like to?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; I’d like to.”</p>

<p>“Tell us where them emeralds aire!” yelled Toby
Sam.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll let me go free.”</p>

<p>“We will, when the boss comes, if you speak honest.
Them emeralds aire the things we’re after.”</p>

<p>“That’s your solemn promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Now, where aire they?”</p>

<p>Toby Sam still held his revolver cocked.</p>

<p>“Those emeralds are in the possession of Miss Forest.
I can tell you that now, for she is on the stage,
and the stage has got such a start of you that you
couldn’t overtake it, no matter how hard you might
try. She has got them; and they’re safe.”</p>

<p>A roar of surprise and anger arose.</p>

<p>“But, see here,” said Toby Sam argumentatively, “I
was under her house when she and Buffler Bill war
talkin’ of how they war goin’ to send them emeralds
on; and I heard her say that she would give ’em to
you to carry, ’cause then they’d be safer, fer no one
would be expectin’ you to have ’em. What about
that? Ain’t that right?”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt you were sneak enough to crawl under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the house and listen in that way, since you
admit it.”</p>

<p>“But ain’t that right? Didn’t she say that?”</p>

<p>“I think she did; but she is a woman, and a woman
has an everlasting right to change her mind whenever
she wants to. She changed her mind.”</p>

<p>“And she carried ’em, instead of you?”</p>

<p>“That’s right; she carried them.”</p>

<p>“Why was you along, then?” Toby Sam howled.
“Answer me that!”</p>

<p>“As her escort. I meant to go East with her.”</p>

<p>“What for, if not to carry the emeralds?”</p>

<p>The young man’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“I intended to marry her when we reached the
East,” he admitted.</p>

<p>When some further sharp questions and threats did
not change the prisoner’s story, Toby Sam and some
of his men drew aside and discussed the matter.</p>

<p>“Better wait fer the comin’ of the boss.”</p>

<p>“But if we wait, then the chance of hittin’ the stage
may be lost,” was the answer to this advice.</p>

<p>After they had talked a while they came back to
Clayton.</p>

<p>“Young feller,” said Toby Sam, “we aire fer the
present believin’ what you’ve told us about them emeralds.
We’re goin’ to hold you, because, if you’ve
lied, then we’ll have a happy settlement with you later;
and, further, because we wants to hear what the boss
says about it. But we’re goin’ to send a man to the
railroad. He’ll manage to git into communication with
the young lady you’re sweet on; and he’ll say to her:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
‘We’re holdin’ the man you expect to marry. You’ve
got certain emeralds we’re interested in. Hand over
them emeralds, and we’ll let your feller go free. Otherwise,
we cuts short his career with a swift bullet!’”</p>

<p>“And now, to furnish proof to her that we have
really got you, and aire meanin’ bizness, we’re goin’
to ask ye to write her a little letter&mdash;jes’ a few words
from you to her, to that effeck. If she does hand over
the emeralds to our man, well and good fer you; but
if she don’t, then we ruther think that we’ll snuff out
your life lamp in a hurry. What d’ye say?”</p>

<p>Bruce took time to consider this.</p>

<p>“May I write what I please,” he asked, “or what I’m
ordered?”</p>

<p>“You writes what we tells you.”</p>

<p>“Then I refuse to write anything.”</p>

<p>He set his jaws stubbornly.</p>

<p>Toby Sam’s big revolver appeared again, threatening
him.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Clayton. “Shoot me, if you
want to, and then you’ll never get those emeralds.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you write?” Toby Sam demanded.</p>

<p>There were harsh and angry cries from the other
men.</p>

<p>“I’ll write to her to sell enough of the gems to get
a thousand dollars, and to pay it over only after I’m
released.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t! We has all them emeralds, or
we has your life!”</p>

<p>“Crack away!” said Clayton defiantly. “If you kill
me, remember that you won’t get anything.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="fs70">SETTING A TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>While they were still talking, Black John made his
appearance, riding up in such furious haste that his
horse was white with foam. He had circled the pursuers
and got ahead of them.</p>

<p>“Git a move on ye!” he commanded.</p>

<p>“But, see here,” said Toby Sam, “does you understand
ther situation? This feller didn’t have the emeralds
at all, but the girl’s got ’em, and she’s on the
stage; so we’re figurin’ about sendin’ a man to the
railroad, and tryin’ to open up negotiations with her,
and sorter trade him to her fer the emeralds. We
reckon it may work.”</p>

<p>Black John answered, with an oath:</p>

<p>“She didn’t go on the stage, but jumped out; and
now she’s with Buffalo Bill, Pawnee Bill, and that old
trapper, and they’re follerin’ your trail.”</p>

<p>It was a study in human nature to watch the effect
of this revelation. It held singular proof of the fear
which the names of Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill had
inspired in such men. They were almost in a panic,
some of them jerking the heads of their horses round
as if they wished to ride away as quickly as they
could.</p>

<p>Black John had the buckskin bag of emeralds at the
moment in an inner pocket of his coat, but he did not
mention that to them. He had made up his mind to
keep the emeralds for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span></p>

<p>Another desire had come into his heart&mdash;the desire
to rid himself forever of the pursuit of Buffalo Bill
and his companions. Buffalo Bill had an unpleasant
way of taking a trail and staying with it until he accomplished
what he set out for. To stop Buffalo Bill
it would be necessary to kill him. Of that Black
John was certain. So now he had planned to compass
the death of Buffalo Bill and his comrades, and to capture
the girl.</p>

<p>If the girl was captured and the emeralds were not
found on her, that could not be charged to him; and
if she should admit that they had been hidden, and
should point out the place, and then they were not
found, that could not be charged against him.</p>

<p>Altogether, he fancied he had worked out a clever
plan, and at once proposed it.</p>

<p>“Ride on,” he said, “and I’ve got a proposition to
talk over as we go.”</p>

<p>He stared at the prisoner through the holes of his
black half mask, and Bruce Clayton returned the stare
with interest.</p>

<p>It was a strange-looking cavalcade that moved on&mdash;the
prisoner bound and tied to his horse in the midst
of those masked figures.</p>

<p>Black John unfolded his plan:</p>

<p>“We can lay fer ’em and trap ’em, and git the emeralds
from the girl, and at the same time wipe out
Buffalo Bill and the devils that aire with him. It’s
the trick to play.”</p>

<p>It did not suit Toby Sam, the coward. And others
of the gang shared his feelings and his fears. Buffalo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Bill, Pawnee Bill, and old Nick Nomad were noted
as the most desperate fighters of the border, and they
were men not easy to trap. It was a certain thing
that in an attempt to “wipe them out,” some of the
outlaws would meet death. Toby Sam and those who
thought as he did were not yet ready to die.</p>

<p>“It’d be a better and a safer plan,” said Toby Sam,
“if we git word to ’em that we’ll swap this young
feller fer the emeralds. That girl will jump at the
offer, fer she’s goin’ to marry this feller. She’ll take
that bait quick; and, as far as the young feller is concerned,
we don’t want him, and if we keep him we’ll
jes’ have to kill him.”</p>

<p>Even as he talked, Toby Sam looked backward, fearing
to see the pursuing scouts.</p>

<p>“If we git them emeralds,” he added, “and make a
divvy, we’ll be that well fixed fer money that we can
quit this hyer other bizness we’ve been workin’.”</p>

<p>He meant the mustang catching. They followed
mustang catching as a blind. As mustangers, they
had an excuse for being in that part of the country,
and for shifting from point to point; and mustanging
explained the money they occasionally displayed in
the gambling resorts and saloons of the towns. They
did not really care for mustanging, though they were
glad enough to sell the mustangs they caught.</p>

<p>Toby Sam, being disguised and anxious to conceal
his identity from Bruce, did not say “mustanging,” yet
his comrades knew what he meant.</p>

<p>Black John was not pleased to see so many of his
men incline to Toby Sam’s view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve got to wipe out them cussed scouts!” he declared.
“We’ll all be in the penitentiary inside of a
month if we don’t. And the thing now will be dead
easy. Jes’ lay fer ’em, as they come follerin’ on our
trail, shoot ’em from ambush, and that ends ’em.
Nothing dangerous er to be skeered of about that.”</p>

<p>Black John’s position as “boss,” together with his
arguments, won; and the outlaws began to look for a
good point for an ambuscade.</p>

<p>They found it soon, on a hillside that overlooked a
narrow pass through which the pursuers would be expected
to go. They rode through the pass, circuited
around, and gained the hillside, and lay down there
under some scrubby trees.</p>

<p>Their horses were placed beyond the hill, and the
prisoner was left there in charge of two men, one
of whom was Toby Sam. For Black John knew what
a coward Toby was, and feared to place him where
he might think his precious hide was in danger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">A CAPTURE AND AN ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill came in sight of the hill where
the outlaws lay waiting for him, and saw the narrow
pass through which he must go, he stopped, for he
was wary and alert to discover signs of danger.</p>

<p>“They were in a great hurry here,” he said, “and I
suppose they went right on; but, just the same, that
looks too favorable for a trap, and I think we’ll investigate
it.”</p>

<p>He brought out his field glasses and surveyed the
sides of the hill and the pass as well as he could, without
discovering anything.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill and Nomad also scanned the suspected
points, and saw nothing out of the way.</p>

<p>“If any one is there, they see us, or have seen us,”
said the scout.</p>

<p>He turned his horse about and rode behind a hill,
and the others did the same.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill wished heartily that Lena Forest was
not with his party. He did not doubt her courage.
But she was a young woman, and in the wild work
he anticipated there was no place for a woman, however
brave she was. Yet he knew that she would not
go back. She had already refused to do that; and,
of course, he could not leave her without protection.
But now he made another suggestion, without believing
she would accept it. This suggestion was for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
to accompany Pawnee Bill to the town of Glendive,
where she could remain, and Pawnee Bill could gather
a force there and hurry back with it.</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill stood ready to go, but Lena Forest
demurred.</p>

<p>“I am not a child, and I’m not a weakling, if I am
a woman,” she declared. “I’ve given way to you,
and have left the emeralds behind; but I’m going on,
in this trail, when you go on, if I have to walk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride for help,” said Pawnee Bill, “though you
know, Cody, that if you’re to mix in any fighting, I’d
rather be in it with you than to eat when I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>After a time of discussion, Pawnee Bill departed, on
a swift ride for assistance.</p>

<p>“I can’t go on,” said Buffalo Bill, “until I’m positive
no road agents are on that hillside. So, if you
will stay here with Nomad, Lena, I’ll make it my business
to find out.”</p>

<p>“Look out fer yerself, Buffler, when ye do!” Nomad
warned.</p>

<p>Black John was as wily and wary as Buffalo Bill.
He had seen the scout; and, while leaving the most of
his men to guard the pass, he was himself, with a few
others, moving swiftly, for the purpose of trapping
the scout where he was.</p>

<p>Hence it happened that while Buffalo Bill was stealing
along under cover of the hills, intending to swing
in a semicircle and get behind the outlaws, if they were
on that hillside, Black John was riding as silently in a
semicircle round in the other direction, intending either
to trap the scout and his companions in the scrubby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
grove, or drive them into the pass, where they would
come under the guns of the road agents there.</p>

<p>When Black John came in sight of the spot where
he thought to find Buffalo Bill, both the scouts were
gone. But Nomad was there, with Lena Forest.</p>

<p>“Cody and his pard have rid on toward the pass,”
was Black John’s conclusion, “and the boyees will rake
’em in there. So here we go for to rake in the two
we sees before us. Now we put our hands on them
emeralds, fer here’s ther girl that’s got ’em.”</p>

<p>He could hardly repress a smile, for he felt the buckskin
bag of emeralds pressing in a lump against his
flesh, under his coat.</p>

<p>But that mention of the emeralds was a bait for the
men, and they moved forward with him, making a
clever sneak upon the trapper and the girl.</p>

<p>Nomad was talking in a fatherly way with Lena
Forest, telling her that she was foolish in insisting on
staying with Buffalo Bill, when all she could do was to
hamper him.</p>

<p>“Ye see, I’m older’n he is,” he was saying, “and so
I’ve got past ther p’int where I’m skeered ter say my
say ter a woman because her face is purty. ‘Purty is
as purty does’ ter me now; though onct there war a
time when ther sight of a flutterin’ dress would set
my heart ter knockin’, and I wouldn’t had any more
sense than a two-year-old. Them times is gone by;
I’m old, and I’m thet humly that I’m ashamed ter look
in a lookin’-glass, and I know it. So I kin afford ter
speak plain ter ye. You’re makin’ things hard fer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
Buffler by insistin’ on stayin’ with him. ’Tain’t no
proper place for a woman, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how can I leave Bruce and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thar ye go; thar ye go! When a gal gits in love
she loses her sense. And that’s what ails ye. I don’t
object ter ye thinkin’ proper good and strong of ther
man ye expect ter marry; but at ther same time, hoss
sense is hoss sense, and not somethin’ diff’runt. I say
thet you ought to go to ther town, and thet yer ought
ter have gone when Pawnee Bill went. And I say,
furder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was not given an opportunity to say anything
further. Old Nebuchadnezzar, his homely, shaggy-headed
horse, thrust out his nose, scented into the
bushes, and then gave a jump and a squeal.</p>

<p>It was a warning; old Nebby was a veritable watchdog.
But the warning came too late.</p>

<p>Before Nomad could seize his rifle, three men burst
through the bushes, and each covered him with a revolver.
They were Black John and two of his men,
and two more came in sight a minute later.</p>

<p>“Surrender!”</p>

<p>Nomad was almost too chagrined for words. He
knew that he was to blame for permitting these men to
sneak on him undiscovered in that way, and hold him
up at the point of the revolver.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar bared his greenish teeth, and in
another moment would have been at the throat of the
nearest man.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Nebby!” Nomad yelled. He had seen the
man pitch up a revolver, and knew that Nebby would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
get the bullet. He knew, too, that a bullet would be
his own portion if he made an attempt to run.</p>

<p>“Ketched nappin’!” he said, lowering his rifle. “Yer
aire too many fur me. But if I hadn’t been a fool,
’twouldn’t happened.”</p>

<p>Lena was too startled and too frightened for words.
She stared at the masked outlaws, her eyes big and
bright, her face turning white.</p>

<p>“Drop your gun!” Black John commanded.</p>

<p>Nomad looked at him hard, and let the rifle slide
to the ground.</p>

<p>“I’m a fool, but I don’t skeer easy,” he said; “and
I know who ye aire, old hoss, which I’ll say it if I
never speak another word. Why don’t you take that
devil’s han’k’cher off’n yer face?”</p>

<p>Black John came forward, holding his revolver in
readiness.</p>

<p>“Keep him covered!” he called out. “Where’s the
rest of your crowd?”</p>

<p>“Yer aire lookin’ at ther whole of them,” said Nomad.
“Me and my daughter, hyar.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your daughter! Where’s Cody and Lillie?”</p>

<p>“I hesertates ter say, not knowin’.”</p>

<p>“They were with you a few moments ago. I reckon
they’ve gone on toward the pass. Well, we’ll bag ’em
there.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t sech fools as me,” said Nomad bitterly.
“When I git through with this trail, I’m goin’ ter quit,
and retire ter some quiet home fer men thet has lost
their senses. If I’d had mine, you wouldn’t ketched
me like this. But it’s all right; I’m old, and ain’t got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
too many years in this world, and you can’t skeer me.
But I does ax yer to be easy wi’ ther gal.”</p>

<p>“Search her,” said Black John, to one of his men.</p>

<p>The masked bandit came forward.</p>

<p>“You’ve got some em’rulds,” said this rascal. “Fork
’em over, and save yerself trouble.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t them!” she protested.</p>

<p>“Fork ’em over!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I haven’t them. We left them behind; but where,
I refuse to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Search her!” said Black John, grinning in a knowing
way.</p>

<p>The man sprang upon the frightened girl, and the
next moment it seemed that he would tear her clothing
from her body.</p>

<p>It was too much for Nomad. Regardless of the
revolvers leveled on him, he leaped to Lena’s aid.
With a blow of his fist he laid the miscreant on the
ground. At the same time his shrill whistle to Nebuchadnezzar
sounded, and the old horse came jumping
to his side.</p>

<p>“Git on him!” Nomad yelled to the girl, as he
fought with another outlaw who assailed him.</p>

<p>Lena tried to obey, but her skirts were caught by
the fallen rascal, and she was thrown down.</p>

<p>Black John came to the assistance of the man who
was battling with Nomad, and in a few moments the
old man was conquered; and then his hands were
bound, while he was held down.</p>

<p>“Shoot him!” snarled the rascal who had been
bowled over by Nomad’s gnarled fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span></p>

<p>“Not yit!” Black John commanded. He put up a
hand for silence. “Mebbe that’ll draw Cody and Pawnee
Bill,” he said; “and if they come we’ll have a fight,
er mebbe we can capture ’em here. Listen!”</p>

<p>But if the sounds had reached Buffalo Bill, there
was nothing to indicate it.</p>

<p>Nomad looked regretfully at the girl, who, frightened
and trembling, was standing close by, one of the
outlaws grasping her by the arm.</p>

<p>“Too bad, leetle gal,” he said; “but I’ve allus noticed
thet storms never last, and thet bright weather allus
comes after they’re over. It’s hard lines fer ye now,
but better times is comin’.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” commanded Black John, who was still
hearkening for some sound of the approach of Buffalo
Bill, and of Pawnee Bill, whom he thought with
him.</p>

<p>Old Nebuchadnezzar, his bridle held by one of the
masked men, was dancing in uneasiness and anger.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Nebuchadnezzar!” said Nomad. The uneasy
horse gave him an idea. Nebby was within a
yard of him, and on Nebby’s back was his old, high-horned
saddle. Nomad’s feet were not yet bound,
though that would come soon, he knew.</p>

<p>The shrill whistle, in a different key, rose from his
lips. He jumped to the horse and threw his bound
hands up, so that the cords which held his wrists
together hooked over the saddle horn.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar gave so shrill a squeal that it was
almost a scream, and at the same time gave a jump and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
lunge which hurled to the ground the man who was
holding the bridle.</p>

<p>The man tried to cling to the rein and stop the
furious old horse, but Nebuchadnezzar trod him under
foot; and the next moment he was “running away,”
with old Nomad swinging along, supported by the saddle
horn.</p>

<p>The old man had not taken time to get into the saddle&mdash;had
feared to try that&mdash;but was hoping the horse
would bear him beyond the outlaws, and that he could
in some manner escape.</p>

<p>Black John and some of the other outlaws pitched
up their revolvers; but instantly Black John lowered
his.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” he said, for he did not want to send
such an alarm to Buffalo Bill. He had the girl, whom
he had desired, and as for old Nomad, he did not care
much about him, one way or another. Buffalo Bill
and Pawnee Bill he desired to capture, or to kill.
Hence his caution.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” he said again.</p>

<p>“But he’s gittin’ away!”</p>

<p>“Let him go! He’s no good to us, anyhow. But
Cody and Pawnee Bill will be comin’ back here purty
soon, in answer to that racket. They’ll want to see
what it means, an’ we’ll rake ’em in right here, if the
boyees down at the pass don’t do it. Down with you
fellers, and git the horses back; and don’t one of ye
so much as breathe. Here, young lady, come with
me, and keep yer handsome mouth shet, er I’ll put a
knife into it, by way of a gag.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p>The escape of Nick Nomad had come with such
stunning suddenness that Lena Forest could hardly
credit it, and knew not what to do, or think.</p>

<p>When Black John seized her by the wrist and drew
her back into the bushes, she did not at first make
any resistance, but she began to struggle when she
comprehended what this meant&mdash;the capture of Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>“I shall cry out and warn him,” was her thought.
“They can’t scare me enough to keep me from doing
that.”</p>

<p>She was thinking, too, in a wild way, of Bruce,
wondering where he was, for she had been sure he was
with the road agents. Though she could not see their
faces, she was certain these were the road agents who
had held up the stage, and, therefore, that they were
the same scoundrels who held Bruce a prisoner.</p>

<p>She forgot the torn and shocking condition of her
dress, in her desire to warn Buffalo Bill. And lest
the outlaws should gag her, or remove her to some
other place, she tried to give them now as little trouble
as possible. So she crouched down, as Black John
ordered her to, and listened with the listening outlaws
for some sound that would show Buffalo Bill was
returning.</p>

<p>However, that sound did not come, nor was anything
heard from the direction of the pass to indicate
that the scout had fallen into the ambush laid for
him there.</p>

<p>“Cuss him!” said Black John, breathing hard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
“What’s happened, I wonder? He and Pawnee Bill
ought to have heard that row, and be comin’ back.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the gal, anyway,” said one of the rascals,
with a grin; “and I’m believin’ she must have
them em’rulds. If she ain’t, he has; and we’ll git
’em, er know why.”</p>

<p>The “he” referred to Bruce Clayton.</p>

<p>Still no sound reached them indicating the return of
the two scouts.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE EMERALDS GONE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Black John and his masked bandits had
waited so long for the return of Buffalo Bill and Pawnee
Bill that their patience was worn out, they left
the concealment of the bushes.</p>

<p>It was certain that the scouts had not fallen into
the trap in the pass. If that had happened, rifle shots
and the sounds of a conflict would have notified them.</p>

<p>Everywhere was a silence that was trying to Black
John. Nomad had vanished as if into space; and,
though they might have picked up and followed the
trail of his horse, the outlaws did not think that would
justify the loss of time necessary. They were more
interested in the two scouts.</p>

<p>Leaving the bushes, and circling back by the route
they had come in reaching them, taking their girl prisoner
with them, they gained again the hillside, where
the other outlaws were waiting for the scouts.</p>

<p>Toby Sam was much relieved when he saw his chief.
He felt sure that for a time the danger of a fight
had passed.</p>

<p>“Seen nothin’ o’ ’em,” was Black John’s question.</p>

<p>“Nary a hair,” said Toby Sam. “But you seem to
have struck suthin’. We heerd a racket up there, and
some of ther boys was fer goin’ ter see what it meant;
but I told ’em to stay here. Orders is orders, and that’s
what you tole us ter do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span></p>

<p>Clayton, who had been held in a hollow to the rear,
was brought out, and Lena could not repress a cry
when she beheld her lover. She marked his haggard
face, but most she noted his bearing of courage and
reliance. She would have rushed to him, but one of
the bandits held her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bruce! Bruce!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Cough up them em’rulds!” said one of the outlaws,
“and then both o’ ye can go free.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you mean it?” she cried, in a manner to
make the bandits think she intended their instant surrender.</p>

<p>Black John opened his eyes, wondering if there were
other emeralds of which he had no knowledge, and he
listened for her further statement.</p>

<p>“I haven’t them,” she said, “as I’ve already told
you; but I know where they are; and if you will really
release us, I’ll gladly show you where they are. I’ll
guide you to them. Oh, can I trust you? Will you
let us go?”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in agitation, and looked round
on the masked faces.</p>

<p>“Can I trust you? Would you let us go, after getting
those emeralds?”</p>

<p>“Young lady,” said Black John, “we would. Show
us where they aire, and as soon as we git our fingers
on ’em we’ll turn you loose.”</p>

<p>He wanted his men to see that he was “doing all he
could to get the emeralds for them.”</p>

<p>He began to question the girl, and got from her a
repetition of the statement that she would show them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
where the emeralds were concealed, on their promise
to let her and Bruce Clayton go free.</p>

<p>She believed that Buffalo Bill and old Nomad could
take care of themselves; and as for Pawnee Bill, she
thought he was hurrying out of the country, on his
way to Glendive. Her desire to secure the freedom
of Bruce Clayton made her selfish, perhaps, in some
points. The emeralds were as nothing to her, when
compared with his safety.</p>

<p>Black John had taken a sudden and violent liking
for the girl.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut loose from the others,” he told himself, “and
slide; and when I do I’ll take the emeralds, and I’d like
to take her. I suppose she’d make a rumpus, and all
that, but what do I care? I can manage her; if no
other way, I can whale her, like the Injuns do their
squaws. I reckon that would fetch her to her senses.
With the money them emeralds will bring, I could
hide out in Mexico somewheres, and live like a prince,
and never do no more work, ner run any more risk.”</p>

<p>Black John had as little knowledge of the heart of
a true and refined woman as if he were an Indian.
Such women as he had known were of the lower,
coarser sort, and he judged all women by them.</p>

<p>“We’ll look round a bit,” he said to his men, for
he had lost none of his craftiness, “and we’ll see what’s
become of Buffalo Bill and his pard. And I wonder
where that old trapper went to? That was a clever
thing he done, I’ll say! Also, it was reckless; fer if
we hadn’t been afraid to shoot we could have downed
him and his horse dead easy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>

<p>He took a couple of men and began to scout about,
hoping to discover what had become of Pawnee Bill
and Cody; but he saw nothing.</p>

<p>“Beats my time!” he said. “They was right over
there and follerin’ our trail, but soon’s we laid a trap
fer ’em they dropped out of sight. Yit I know that
neither them ner their horses kin fly. And I don’t see
that old trapper nowhere. He’s a smart one, and no
mistake. I reckon he and that old horse o’ his aire
hidin’ in some holler, and keepin’ as close to the grass
and bushes as if they was a pair of rabbits.”</p>

<p>He spent almost an hour in this scouting trip, and
returned with his companions no wiser than when he
went.</p>

<p>Toby Sam was talking with the prisoners when
Black John returned, and the prisoners seemed in remarkably
good spirits.</p>

<p>Black John now moved his men along the backward
way, but not on the backward trail, and was soon
leaving the hillside and the pass behind him.</p>

<p>The girl kept her own counsel, and did not tell them
that Pawnee Bill had departed for Glendive.</p>

<p>When the spot was reached, near the stage trail,
where the emeralds had been concealed, she pointed
it out to them.</p>

<p>Black John could not hide a grin. It was such a
joke&mdash;when he had the emeralds in his pocket!</p>

<p>The bandits saw the fresh earth turned there, and
began to dig with feverish energy. They reached the
bottom of the hole, but found no emeralds.</p>

<p>Then their rage broke bounds; for, suddenly, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
conceived the idea that from the first Lena Forest had
deceived them.</p>

<p>If it had not been for Black John they would now
have treated her outrageously, and might have shot
her, and her lover as well.</p>

<p>Black John did not care for Clayton, but he meant
to protect the girl. He put himself in front of her,
and drew his revolver.</p>

<p>“Who’s the boss of this beehive?” he demanded
harshly, fingering his pistol. “You’ll know that I am,
if you try any rushin’. Stand back, there! And you,
Toby Sam, shet yer yawp, er I’ll fill yer ugly mouth
with bullets. Let’s hear what the girl’s got to say.”</p>

<p>They clamored for her to speak, but she was mystified,
puzzled, chagrined.</p>

<p>“I saw them hidden there!” she said.</p>

<p>“Then somebody’s dug ’em up!” was the disgusted
statement. “Somebody seen ’em hid here, and dug
’em up; and where they aire now ther Lord knows;
but we’ve seen the last of them em’rulds, unless the
young lady is lyin’.”</p>

<p>They stared at her, and at Black John, who stood
in front of her.</p>

<p>“Mebbe we kin hit the trail of the feller that done
it?” Black John suggested. He set to work to do
that, but pointed out the trail of the scouts, instead of
his own.</p>

<p>He could afford to laugh at these men, now that he
had the gems. He was already wondering how he
was to get away from them, and take the girl with
him.</p>

<span class="fs70">CODY AND NOMAD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill had seen the movements of the outlaws
under Black John, and had discovered the ambush laid
for him on the hillside. He had heard the outcry made
when Nomad escaped, and then he had caught a
glimpse of the old trapper getting away, with his
shaggy-headed horse.</p>

<p>The great scout was too wise to show himself; he
was but one man, and the road agents numbered nearly
a score. He was already satisfied that they were the
mustangers, or that some of them were, and that the
mustang catching was but a side issue, carried on
chiefly for the purpose of blinding people to their real
work.</p>

<p>The fact that old Nomad seemed to be dragged by
his horse, instead of riding on the back of the animal,
suggested trouble for the old man, though the scout
did not understand the nature of it.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill now concealed his horse in a hollow that
was filled with bushes, and then on foot made his way
in the direction of Nomad’s flight. He was worried
about the safety of the girl, whom he had left with
Nomad. More than ever he wished she would be
tractable, and that she had started for Glendive with
Pawnee Bill.</p>

<p>In going forward now, Buffalo Bill used the utmost
carefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span></p>

<p>The thick growth of bushes that covered the land
except in spots, while offering him protection, screened
as well much of the movements of the road agents,
so that he was in constant danger of blundering into
them at the most unexpected point.</p>

<p>His wariness, his keen eyesight, and trained hearing
stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>He found the hoofprints of Nebuchadnezzar, and
began to follow them. That the tracks were made by
Nomad’s horse he knew from the fact that recently
Nebuchadnezzar had broken a triangular piece out of
his right fore hoof. The impression in the soil was
unmistakable, to a man trained as the scout was in the
fine art of trailing.</p>

<p>Half an hour or more afterward the scout saw indications
that the old horse had entered a small grove,
near a little stream. He could not see the horse in
there, and he began to fear that here was an ambush.
He knew Nebby might have run into a bunch of road
agents in that grove and been captured, with his owner,
and the road agents might be lying in wait for any
friend of Nomad who followed his trail.</p>

<p>Standing off at a distance, concealed by trees and
rocks, Buffalo Bill uttered the “cuckoo” cry of the
little prairie-dog owl. It was a signal well understood
by Nomad, when made in a peculiar way; and when
from the grove there came an answering cry, the scout
knew that in there no ambush existed.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he called, as he now boldly advanced.</p>

<p>“Thet you, Buffler?” came in a strained voice.</p>

<p>Nomad did not appear, and the thing seemed suspicious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
so the scout went on, with revolver held ready
for use.</p>

<p>When he had penetrated the grove, he found a
strange state of affairs. Nomad lay on the ground,
gasping, and almost breathless, his hands bound together
at the wrist. The ground seemed torn up by
his own efforts, for no enemy was to be seen. Close
by stood old Nebuchadnezzar, looking at Nomad, and
then turning his sad eyes on Buffalo Bill, as if to inquire
the meaning of something he had not brain
enough to fathom.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill hurried forward and cut the cords from
Nomad’s wrists. Nomad rolled over to a sitting position.</p>

<p>“Waugh!” he grunted, puffing his cheeks and blowing
dirt out of his mouth. “Buffler, talk er ground
hogs! I been ground-hoggin’ in the wust way ever.
Fer an hour, seems ter me, I been kickin’ round hyar
wuss’n any cussed grasshopper. Whar’d ye come
frum? And shake! I never war so glad ter see anybody
in all my bornd days!”</p>

<p>He extended his hand. The lines of the cords,
where they had cut into his wrists, showed red, and
deeply indented.</p>

<p>“Who tied you?” asked the scout, mystified, and
glancing all around him. “I don’t see any trail here
but yours.”</p>

<p>“Waugh! Let me git my wind, Buffler, and I’ll
norate a tale fer ye that’ll make yer eyes bug out. I
rid hyar bound thet way, and I didn’t ride in the saddle,
nuther; couldn’t git up inter ther saddle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span></p>

<p>Then he told, in his own peculiar phraseology, of
how he had been surprised and captured by the road
agents, and of the manner of his singular escape, aided
by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>“Thar never war yit another sech hoss, Buffler, on
the top o’ ther airth!” he declared, with characteristic
enthusiasm. “Whoa, Nebby, consarn ye; don’t git
bashful and restless jes’ ’cause I’m praisin’ ye! Stan’
still, thar!” He looked lovingly at the homely old
beast. “Nebby seen jes’ ther fix I war in, and he felt
jes’ as bad as I did, and war jes’ as ’shamed o’ ther
way we had been caught nappin’. And so he war
ready fer somethin’ desprit, and he done it. I jes’
hooked my two tied hands over the horn o’ ther saddle
and Nebby carried me off, same’s as if I war a bag o’
meal hooked onter him. It war ther greatest thing
I ever knowed on, Buffler, an’ no mistake. But after
Nebby’d done his part, I still seemed ter be not much
better off. I got my hands from over the saddle horn,
but I couldn’t ontie ’em. I tried to gnaw ther cords
loose, but my ole teeth has seen their best days, and
I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t break ther cords, and thar
I war; fer, smart as Nebby is, I couldn’t nowise git
him ter do anything. I tried ter git him ter bite at
ther cords, but he wouldn’t, and jes’ stood lookin’ at
me, wonderin’ what kind of a crazy fit I war havin’;
fer I war shore pawin’ up ther ground suthin’ dreadful,
in tryin’ ter git myself free.”</p>

<p>The old trapper told what he knew of the girl who
had been left behind in the power of the road agents,
and of the road agents themselves; though this last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
was little enough, and largely guesswork, as he had
not seen their faces.</p>

<p>The scout saw that some strenuous and perilous
work was cut out for him. At all hazards, Lena must
be rescued, and her lover as well.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to lie low a while,” he said to Nomad.
“We’ll strike their trail after they’ve gone on, and
then we’ll do what we can.”</p>

<p>Old Nomad made a grimace.</p>

<p>“Buffler, I feels like lyin’ low fer a week; fer I’m
thet stiff and sore thet every inch o’ me feels as ef it
had been beat with an ox whip. I reckon I’ve got
you to thank fer my life, too; fer, try as I would,
I couldn’t git rid of them cords on my wrists. And,
gee, but them wrists aire hurtin’ yit!”</p>

<p>They were red and swollen, and very painful.</p>

<p>From the top of the nearest hill, to which he climbed
with great carefulness, Buffalo Bill viewed, as well as
he could, the surrounding country. He saw the road
agents under Black John moving off in the direction
of the stage trail. It surprised him, and for a time
puzzled him; then he hit on what seemed to him the
true solution.</p>

<p>“They’ve forced Lena Forest to tell them where the
emeralds are buried, and they’re going to get them.
Too bad! But I don’t see how it’s to be prevented
now. Of course, no one can blame her for telling,
when, no doubt, she was threatened, and frightened.”</p>

<p>He surveyed the returning cavalcade with his field
glasses; and saw the two prisoners in the midst of
the outlaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span></p>

<p>As he lay thus on the top of the hill, he saw on another
hill, some distance away, a horseman appear.
He swung the glasses around and pointed them at this
horseman, while a cry of surprise broke from his lips.</p>

<p>“Pawnee Bill!”</p>

<p>And Pawnee Bill was supposed to be at that moment
speeding on his way to Glendive!</p>

<p>Deeming it safe to do so, Buffalo Bill stood up and
waved his hat about his head. But the signal was not
observed by Pawnee Bill, who was looking at Black
John’s men.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill saw the horseman begin to descend from
the hill, with the apparent intention of following the
road agents.</p>

<p>Therefore, he quickly climbed down himself, and
returned in haste to Nomad with his astonishing news.</p>

<p>The scout and Nomad rode out of the grove, and,
following swiftly in the course taken by Pawnee Bill,
soon overtook him. He was not at all surprised to
see them.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking for you,” he said. “From the
top of that high hill away over there I saw, with my
glasses, that something had gone wrong; and so I
back-tracked, and here I am. What’s the news?”</p>

<p>They had enough to tell him, of a surprising character.</p>

<p>“I guess it was Nomad’s fight and capture that I
saw,” he said. “As you are both all right, perhaps
I’d better go on again. I came back because I thought
likely I was needed.”</p>

<p>As, in pursuing the road agents now, toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
stage trail, the scouts were really going somewhat in
the direction of Glendive, Pawnee Bill kept with them.</p>

<p>Before the stage trail was reached they saw the
bandits returning, still with their prisoners.</p>

<p>Night was at hand.</p>

<p>Black John had got rid of most of his men, having
only six or eight with him now, among them Toby
Sam. Little by little he was reducing his force, sending
men here and there on various pretexts. In this
manner, he thought to get rid of them all, by and by,
and have the prisoners himself; when he meant to
put the young man out of the way, and fly with the
young woman and the emeralds.</p>

<p>The fact that Black John’s force had been reduced
caused a change of plan on the part of the scouts.</p>

<p>It was decided that it was not necessary to send
Pawnee Bill on to Glendive for assistance, but that the
wisest course now was for the three pards to remain
together, and, in the darkness, try to get at the prisoners
and release them. Therefore, when they fell in
behind Black John’s party, and began to follow this
trail, they kept a sharp outlook ahead, expecting that
soon he would go into camp for the night, when they
would endeavor to put their plan of rescue into execution.</p>

<p>But Black John did not go into camp. He pushed
straight on in the gathering darkness. Before coming
to the region where he might expect to encounter
Buffalo Bill, he shifted his course to miss him and
then hurried on again.</p>

<p>Black John’s carelessness of pursuit enabled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
scouts to keep pretty close to him, after darkness fell,
and still not reveal themselves.</p>

<p>Hour after hour Black John and his men held on
their way.</p>

<p>After a while he became suspicious, apparently, having
heard the pursuers, and dropped a scout back as a
rear guard; thus forcing Buffalo Bill and his companions
to halt.</p>

<p>When this rear guard went on again, he rode rapidly
for some rendezvous, failing to rejoin Black
John; and soon the scouts were bewildered in the darkness,
and almost lost the trail.</p>

<p>For a time after that they sat still on their horses,
trying to hear some sound indicating the direction of
Black John’s retreat. Unable to do this, they were
forced to begin a search for hoofprints; but they lost
time in picking up the trail, and when it was found they
could not follow it rapidly. They held to it, however,
with much pertinacity, though falling rapidly behind
the road agents.</p>

<p>When morning came, after an all-night ride, that, in
their experience, had few equals in weariness, they
were still on the trail, but miles behind. They ignored
their weariness, when they saw the trail stretching
straight on before them, and pressed their horses into
a swift gallop, after a brief stop for water and grazing,
and for food for themselves.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” said Nomad, as they started on, “we hangs
to this hyar trail till ther last hoss is dead!”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE OUTLAWS TRICKED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Black John had got rid of all but six of his men,
one of those remaining being Toby Sam. The others
he had dispatched on various missions, and in that
manner he meant to dispose of them all, one by one.</p>

<p>His horses were nearly exhausted now; he had ridden
hard through the night, and all through the hours
of the forenoon, and the previous day the horses had
little rest.</p>

<p>Lena Forest was almost in a state of collapse, from
exhaustion; and Bruce Clayton was not in much better
state. His hands being tied together, and his feet
tied under the belly of his horse, so cramped him that
at times he suffered not only from fatigue, but such
intense pain that it was torture.</p>

<p>Little Black John cared for these things. He had
an iron frame that resisted fatigue, and his men were
as hardened to such things as himself.</p>

<p>But the exhausted horses had reached a point where
their speed was little better than a walk, and soon they
would be unable to go on.</p>

<p>Even Black John had a mental vision of pursuers
hot on his trail. At this juncture, it seemed to him
a godsend, when he beheld a number of horses grazing
in a little valley, through which ran the trail he
was following.</p>

<p>“Mustangs!” he said. “What luck!”</p>

<p>He and his companions drew rein and looked down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
at the horses. More than a dozen in number, with
heads down, not apparently having seen the horsemen,
they presented a tempting sight to the eyes of Black
John and his comrades.</p>

<p>During the night, grown reckless and tired of wearing
them, Black John and his companions had removed
the half masks that had concealed and disfigured their
countenances, and stood revealed to the prisoners in
their true persons. It was an intimation to the prisoners
that they could not hope to escape, and that
death, or worse, awaited them.</p>

<p>“There’s a cañon over there,” said Black John, as
he studied the mustangs and their situation. “If we
could herd ’em into the mouth o’ that, and then rush
’em, and drive ’em into it, we could ketch some of ’em.
And we’ve got to have some new horses.”</p>

<p>He knew the region, and knew that this cañon became
choked and ended less than a mile back of its
opening; so that, if the horses could be forced into
it, they would fall easy victims to the mustangers.</p>

<p>Acting on Black John’s suggestions, his men spread
out, several hundred yards apart, and began to move
down into the valley.</p>

<p>Black John kept the prisoners with him, and close
by him was Toby Sam.</p>

<p>So certain were the mustangers that the horses
they saw were wild ones that the only care they used
was in endeavoring to ride upon them in such a way as
to throw them toward the mouth of the cañon.</p>

<p>But when the bandits had ridden so close that they
began to wonder at the fact that the mustangs did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
not race away in fright, there was a sudden and
startling transformation.</p>

<p>An Indian appeared on the back of each of the
“mustangs;” an Indian striped and painted hideously,
armed with feathered lance and rifle. These redskins
charged the white men, with hideous yells.</p>

<p>Black John uttered an oath of amazement, and
jerked his tired horse around. He stretched forth a
hand to catch the bridle rein of the horse ridden by
Lena Forest. He saw his comrades lashing their
jaded animals, in efforts to escape, and saw the redskins
riding upon them.</p>

<p>An Indian chief rode toward him, with rifle uplifted.</p>

<p>Black John dropped the bridle rein of the girl’s
horse, and, drawing his revolver, he rode to meet the
chief, firing upon him. He saw the chief tumble to
the ground, with a bullet in his forehead.</p>

<p>Black John was really a capable fighter, the natural
leader of the wild men he grouped about him.</p>

<p>Another Indian was coming toward him, and this
Indian he shot out of the saddle.</p>

<p>But by this time the horse ridden by the girl was
galloping off at its best gait, and was really going
fast, for fright gave it renewed strength.</p>

<p>With a running leap, Black John sprang to the back
of one of the Indian ponies, and then tried to catch the
other.</p>

<p>Several Indians rushing upon him compelled him
to abandon his attempt to capture the second pony.</p>

<p>He yelled defiance at them, as they shot at him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
hurled their lances; and, with backward shots from
his revolver, he rode away at a furious pace, following
the girl.</p>

<p>He saw that several of his men were down, that
others were fighting with Indians, while still others
were, like himself, riding away for safety.</p>

<p>The chase that followed was a hot one, and Black
John was pressed hard; but the pony he now had under
him was fast, and he did not spare it. He overtook
the girl, shouting to her to stop. When she did not,
he rode up beside her galloping horse. Then he fairly
lifted her from its back, throwing her against his side;
and, holding her there by main strength, he galloped
furiously on.</p>

<p>“Git up behind me!” he shouted. “If you don’t,
you’ll tumble, and it will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>She was too weak to obey him; her mind, also, revolted
at the thought of going farther with him. She
preferred to fall to the ground, and meet death there.</p>

<p>In desperation, Black John stopped his horse, and
shifted her to its back, in front of him.</p>

<p>“You go with me,” he said. “D’ye want them Injuns
to git ye? You’re a fool, if ye do!”</p>

<p>The Indian pursuers were coming up rapidly; but
again Black John urged on the plucky mustang, and
found it so superior as a runner that it again drew
away from the Indians, in spite of its double burden.</p>

<p>Lena was in a fainting condition by this time.
Weakened by the terrible exertions she had been forced
to undergo, and by the mental agony she had endured,
she had no strength of mind or body left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span></p>

<p>Black John was separated now from all of his men.
Some of them were down, killed by the redskins; the
others were in flight. Even Toby Sam was no longer
near him.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t be so bad,” was his thought, “if I can
only git away from the Injuns. Whatever turns up
later, I’ll have a good excuse to give for sep’rating
myself from the boyees. I’m hopin’ I’ll never meet
any of ’em again, to make an explanation needful,
but if I should I’ve shorely got it now. But them
cussed Injuns!”</p>

<p>He looked back, and saw several redskins still chasing
him, and he knew if they stuck to it long enough
they would probably tire down his pony, for, in the
long run, the double burden would tell on it. When
that came, he knew he would have to fight the Indians.</p>

<p>“But they’ll think they’ve struck a rattler if they
crowd me!” was his grim thought.</p>

<p>He drove his spurs into the sides of the mustang.
Unused to such things, it jumped forward, with a
squeal of pain, greatly adding to its speed.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it,” was the thought of the ruffian. “And
what more can I want? I’ve got the emeralds and
the girl, and I’ve got rid of the fellers that might be
inclined to make trouble&mdash;would shorely make trouble
if they knowed I had the emeralds. I’ll hit some
trail runnin’ into Mexican territory, and git out of the
country. And then!”</p>

<p>He looked at the white face of the girl, who had
fallen limp in his villainous arms.</p>

<span class="fs70">A ROUGH DIPLOMAT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Lena Forest came to a full realization of
her changed position, she was alone with Black John.</p>

<p>About them were rugged hills, hemming in a little
valley, where the captured Indian pony was grazing.</p>

<p>Black John had gone into camp there, and was cooking
some meat he had found on the Indian pony. He
was not only tired, but by this time ravenously hungry.</p>

<p>“Don’t be skeered,” he said, when he discovered that
Lena was taking note of her surroundings. “I don’t
mean any harm to ye, not in the least.”</p>

<p>She started up, staring about; then turned to him.
Her face was corpselike in its pallor, and she swayed
as she stood up.</p>

<p>“Then, why did you bring me here; and why keep
me here?” she said. “Why don’t you join your men?”</p>

<p>Black John stooped to sniff the roasting meat before
replying.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll tell ye,” he said; “and mebbe you won’t
think it’s so bad. I was your friend from the very
first, but didn’t darst show it. The men wanted you,
and wanted your emeralds. What become of the
emeralds I don’t know, and jes’ now I don’t know
where the other men aire. They was scattered in that
rumpus with the Injuns. You recollect the Injuns,
and what fools we was, in ridin’ up on ’em?”</p>

<p>He stroked his beard, ruminating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span></p>

<p>“The boys was scattered by the Injuns. I got one
of the Injun ponies, and we come here on it; and I
reckon we’re safe enough fer a while.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you leave me here,” she begged, “or take
me back to my friends?”</p>

<p>“What friends?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cody, and&mdash;and the men who were with him.
You don’t know where Bruce Clayton is?”</p>

<p>“Nary, I don’t. He was with our crowd, when the
Injuns hit us; but where he went, and what become
of him, I don’t know no more than you do.” He inspected
the meat. “Won’t you have somethin’ to eat?”
he asked, taking it from the fire and poking into it with
his knife. “This belonged to the Injun that owned
the mustang, but I reckon as he meant to eat it himself
he didn’t pizen it. You look’s if you needed to
eat somethin’.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t swallow a mouthful,” she protested.
“Won’t you please let me go, and let me try to find
my way back?”</p>

<p>“That’s foolish, don’t ye think? Better eat some o’
this meat. It’s good, and you need the stren’th it’ll
give ye. Let me carve ye out a bit of it.”</p>

<p>She protested again that she could not eat.</p>

<p>The outlaw seemed to want to argue the matter with
her. What he really wanted was to hear her talk,
for he liked her voice, and to make her forget if possible
her condition. He was wondering how he could
gain her good will, and perhaps her liking. His ideas
of women were singular. He did not see why this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
girl might not come to like him as much as he now
liked her.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen sich,” he told himself. “Put a couple o’
strange dogs together, and they’ll fight like time; but
after they git acquainted they’re li’ble to be the best
of friends. And other animals the same way. Why
not humans?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he said, beginning to
eat the roasted meat. “I’ll try to find yer friends for
ye, and hand you over to ’em.”</p>

<p>She sprang up and came toward him, wildly excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you will&mdash;if you will!”</p>

<p>He smiled into her flushed face.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll do. I dunno where they aire, and
them Injuns may have struck ’em and even wiped
’em out. I don’t think they did, though. So, we’ll
begin to look fer ’em right off. But if you’re to try
that, or try to do anything, you’ll need to do some
eatin’. You can’t go on much longer if you don’t.
We’re stoppin’ here to give you a chanct to rest, and
the pony needs rest, too. The pony’s fillin’ up on
grass, showin’ how sensible he is.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, when he held out some of the
meat to her.</p>

<p>“But if you don’t, why, ’tain’t no use fer you to try
to do anything. If you’re to find yer friends, you’ve
got to have some stren’th, so that you can do ridin’.”</p>

<p>“You’ll help find my friends?”</p>

<p>“Why, cert’in; ain’t I said so?”</p>

<p>“And Bruce?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; we’ll look fer him, too. I see you don’t
understand my position?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” she confessed frankly.</p>

<p>“Well, as I said, I was friendly toward you from
the first, but couldn’t do anything because of the other
boys. I had to seem rough to ye, on account of that.”</p>

<p>“You were the boss&mdash;the leader?”</p>

<p>“No, you’re mistaken; Toby Sam was the real boss.”
He held out the meat.</p>

<p>“Eat it, and you’ll feel better; and when we go on
you’ll be in better shape to do the ridin’ we’ve got to
do if we strike them friends of yours, if they’re livin’.”</p>

<p>She took the meat, and began to eat it.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said he, smiling encouragement.
“<ins class="corr" id="tn291" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Now, as I said, I coudn’t” changed to “Now, as I said, I couldn’t”.">Now, as I said, I couldn’t</ins>
do anything so long as t’others was with me. But sense I’m alone I
can do as I please. You’ll find I’m not sich a bad man as you’ve
prob’bly been thinkin’.”</p>

<p>They rested by the stream nearly an hour. At the
end of that time Black John ascended the near-by hill
to take a look over the country. He came down hurriedly,
and was much excited.</p>

<p>“Injuns!” he said. “We’ve got to slide out of this
mighty quick, er we won’t be goin’ at all. Wish’t I
had another horse fer ye, but you’ll have to ride in
front of me, same’s before.”</p>

<p>He helped her to mount, and she assisted herself
very materially, for, believing him, she was anxious to
get out of the valley. Then they rode away hastily,
heading once more southward.</p>

<p>She noted the direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>

<p>“This takes me farther and farther from my
friends!” she protested. “We’re riding southward!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but when Injuns aire in the trail right behind
us we ain’t much choice as to the direction we take.
The thing to do is to move as fast as we can out of
the territory. We’ve got a start of ’em; yit I’m expectin’
to hear their yells soon.”</p>

<p>What Black John had really seen from the top of
the hill was Buffalo Bill and his friends, coming toward
the valley at a fast gallop, following his trail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">A WHIRLWIND CHASE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Following hard on the trail of Black John and his
companions, Buffalo Bill, Pawnee Bill, and Nick Nomad
came to the point where Black John’s men had
been fooled by the Indians.</p>

<p>Several bodies, scalped and mutilated, told their
own story.</p>

<p>Indian pony tracks were numerous, and all the evidences
of a surprise and a fight.</p>

<p>Such “signs” were easy to read by men as experienced
as Buffalo Bill and his comrades.</p>

<p>While examining this small battle ground, they
heard a feeble shout, and then beheld a young man
ride out of a timbered gorge and come toward them.</p>

<p>The man was Bruce Clayton.</p>

<p>His hands were still tied behind his back, and his
feet were bound together beneath the pony’s body.
He was almost paralyzed from the constriction of the
cords, and the fact that he had been in that painful
position so long.</p>

<p>He had been unable to guide his horse, except by
pressure of his knees, when the Indian surprise and
attack came, and so the animal had chosen its own
course, dashing away in wild fright.</p>

<p>It bore him into this gorge, and on into the midst
of a growth of brushy timber, some distance from the
mouth of the gorge. There, by voice alone, he had
been able to check it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span></p>

<p>For some reason, perhaps because they were pursuing
other men, the Indians did not follow him, and
he remained there undisturbed a long time, wondering
what he ought to do, or could do. He was unable
to release himself.</p>

<p>By and by the horse grazed its way back to the
mouth of the gorge. Then the unhappy prisoner was
able to ride forth, guiding with his knees, and make
his predicament known.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill lost no time in cutting away the cords
that had held Clayton so long to the back of the
pony.</p>

<p>The youth had to be helped from the saddle. When
he began to talk, it was seen that his mental sufferings
had been as great as his physical. He told them of
the surprise by the Indians, and of what had followed,
so far as he had been able to see it. And he also
told of his own adventures and experiences.</p>

<p>“Lena was with that leader when I saw her last,”
he said. “But I haven’t any idea where she is now.
I fear the worst.”</p>

<p>In spite of their desire to hasten on, the scouts remained
there a long time, a thing which gave Black
John a good start.</p>

<p>They could not go on with Clayton until his physical
condition was improved, nor could they hope to accomplish
much until they had gained something like
accurate knowledge of what had become of the girl.</p>

<p>To the task of learning this last, Buffalo Bill and
Pawnee bent their utmost skill, leaving old Nomad to
minister to the needs of Clayton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span></p>

<p>The scouts had long before picked out the individual
trail of the horse ridden by Black John; but now that
he had secured an Indian pony, they were put to their
wits’ ends to know what to do.</p>

<p>After much searching they came on a bit of evidence
that was of the utmost value. It was a piece of
cloth torn by a thorny bush from Lena’s dress. There
could be no mistaking it, nor how it came to be there.</p>

<p>By this thorny bush they found pony tracks, heading
southward. They studied these tracks, until they
were sure they should know them when seen anywhere;
for, to the experienced eye of the plainsman,
there is as much difference between the tracks made
by different ponies as there is between the penmanship
of different men.</p>

<p>When they had done this much, and had followed
the trail some distance, they returned to where old
Nomad was caring for Bruce Clayton.</p>

<p>The brief rest had done a world of good for the
young man. He had walked by the stream, and so had
got the stiffness and half paralysis out of his body
and limbs. He was still “sore as a boil,” as he expressed
it, but he had had something to eat and drink;
and in his anxiety he now declared that he was himself
again, and was ready to go on, wherever the scouts
went.</p>

<p>He was much encouraged by the report brought in
by his friends, the two scouts. He looked anxiously
at the shred of cloth which they showed, and then
asked if he might have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>

<p>“I may never see her again!” he said simply, as he
put it away in his pocket.</p>

<p>Bruce’s horse was also in better condition now, and
was almost as strong as the worn horses of the scout
and his pards.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was anxious to push on, now that he
felt sure they had found the trail of the pony that had
borne the girl away.</p>

<p>Whether the man who was supposed to be with her
on that pony’s back was Black John, or some one else,
they, of course, did not know.</p>

<p>In spite of the jaded condition of the horses, the
chase that followed was really of a whirlwind character,
as the previous one had been. If their quarry
were Black John, they hoped to bring him in sight
soon, and they drove their horses on without much
mercy.</p>

<p>As has been seen, at a time when Black John began
to feel safe, he had found that these human bloodhounds
were on his track and coming up rapidly.</p>

<p>On gaining the valley where Black John had stopped
to rest and cook some food, the evidences of his presence
there was so fresh, and the signs of his quick
flight so plain, that Buffalo Bill was sure he was not
far ahead. Moreover, as his horse was carrying double,
and was tired, as its trail showed, they began confidently
to believe that in a short time they would be
able to overhaul him and force him to surrender his
fair prisoner.</p>

<p>“Crowd ’im, Buffler!” said Nomad, with youthful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
enthusiasm. “We’re goin’ ter drive him inter a hole
now mighty quick.”</p>

<p>The next moment he was belaboring old Nebuchadnezzar,
to get greater speed out of him.</p>

<p>Thus they swept along, riding hard on the trail of
the fugitive.</p>

<p>The Indian pony took to a rocky gorge, where its
hoofprints were not easily followed; but, as it could
not have left the gorge, they rode straight on at top
speed.</p>

<p>“Go ’long, Nebby, you ole crow bait!” said Nomad.
“Hyar I’ve allus been braggin’ on you bein’ a reg’lar
bird with wings, when it come ter runnin’, and now
you’re hurtin’ my feelin’s by turnin’ inter a snail. Go
’long!”</p>

<p>They came in sight of the pony they were pursuing,
at a bend in the gorge, and they almost reeled in their
saddles when they saw it, so great was their astonishment.</p>

<p>The pony was riderless!</p>

<p>“Waugh!” Nomad roared, drawing rein and staring
stupidly. “Whar’s ther man and ther gal?”</p>

<p>No one could answer his question.</p>

<span class="fs70">LAWLESS STRATEGY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Black John was no fool. In fact, he was both
shrewd and clever, and possessed a foxlike instinct that
stood him in good stead now.</p>

<p>When he discovered that Buffalo Bill and three
other men were near and coming on rapidly, he rode
swiftly out of the valley, with the girl before him,
telling her that he had sighted Indians. His frightened
manner and frantic haste made her believe he told the
truth.</p>

<p>She had no desire to fall again into the hands of
Indians. Her experience with Lightfoot was vivid in
her memory, causing her to shudder at the recollection.
Much as she detested her captor, to be Lightfoot’s
prisoner again would be worse; and now that
Black John was promising to convey her to her
friends without delay, she was beginning to believe in
his sincerity. She did not, therefore, make objection
when he bore her away in front of him on the pony.</p>

<p>He turned into the gorge after a sharp run. His
manner in doing it would have shown her that the
country there was familiar to him, if she had been experienced
in judging of such things.</p>

<p>When he had ridden at top speed some distance into
the gorge, over rocky ground which left no hoofprints,
he drew rein and leaped down.</p>

<p>“We can baffle ’em, I think,” he said, lifting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
from the horse, “if we move lively now. Redskins
aire purty hard ter fool, but I think I can fool these
red gentlemen handsome.”</p>

<p>He looked about a moment, then pulled a leaf of
thorny cactus and thrust it under the saddle girth.</p>

<p>The pain of the cactus caused the horse to rear and
plunge. “Go on with ye now!” he said. “Git!” He
gave it a heavy slap, which started it along the trail.
The pricking of the cactus caused it to continue on
at a headlong gallop.</p>

<p>“Quick, now!” he said, taking the girl by the hand.</p>

<p>She yielded her hand willingly. She was trembling,
frightened, and almost breathless, and her limbs
were quaking under her, so that she could hardly
stand.</p>

<p>“I’ll help ye!” he said encouragingly, pulling her
along, up the rocky slope.</p>

<p>When she stumbled, as she did, now and then, his
hand sustained her from falling; and when places were
reached which she was too weak to surmount he lifted
her in his arms.</p>

<p>Ordinarily she would not have submitted in this way
without taking pains to verify his statements; but she
had suffered so much physically and mentally that
she had lost the faculty of clear judgment. Fear ruled
her now more than anything else.</p>

<p>The iron frame of Black John seemed impervious
to fatigue. He scaled the rocky slope as sure-footed
as a mountain goat. At times he almost ran, even
though he carried the girl and the rocks were formidable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>Before Buffalo Bill and his party reached the pony
and discovered that it had been abandoned. Black
John was over the high ridge out of sight, and descending
rapidly toward a valley of which he knew.
In his work as a mustanger, and also long before, he
had been all through that region; so that he knew
every hole and corner of it. He headed now toward
a deep gorge, which he followed up some distance, and
which led him by and by into a cozy nest, between
green hills. Here there was a small cave, in which
more than once he had spent a night, and below this
cave, and not distant, was a spring of water.</p>

<p>“If we had somethin’ to eat,” he said, when they
had gained this hiding place, “we could lay by here
a week, until them redskins git tired and clear out of
the country. I don’t think they’ll find us here. The
way we come was so rocky that a bloodhound couldn’t
hit the trail and stick to it.”</p>

<p>He laughed with cool assurance.</p>

<p>As for the girl, she sank down in the cave, tired out
and again hopeless.</p>

<p>If they should be cooped up there by Indians any
length of time, she fancied that the chance of meeting
or finding Buffalo Bill and his companions would
be small. And as for Bruce&mdash;she shivered when she
thought of his possible fate, for she could not rid
herself of the fear that he had fallen into the hands
of the Indians.</p>

<p>During the night which followed, Black John lay
with his rifle out beyond the mouth of the cave, watching
for the coming of his enemies, not daring to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span></p>

<p>He believed he was safe, but he was not sure of it.
Buffalo Bill was a hard man to shake off, when once
he set out to run any one down.</p>

<p>During that wakeful night Black John amused and
occupied himself by planning his future with the girl
whom he now believed he could deceive. He fancied
he had gained her confidence, and that she was beginning
to like him, and that promised well. He thought,
too, that the girl was soundly sleeping throughout the
night; but in this he was mistaken, for she slept very
little. At the first faint light of day she had crept
to the cave entrance and looked out.</p>

<p>She saw Black John lying on the ground by a rock,
not far off. That he was not asleep she observed by
his occasional movement; so she slipped out to where
he was, intending to ask him some questions. Before
she reached him she stopped, stupefied with astonishment.</p>

<p>Black John had taken the buckskin bag from his
inner pocket, poured the emeralds on the ground, and
was looking them over, hefting and scanning them,
and estimating their worth.</p>

<p>The cry of the girl aroused him.</p>

<p>She had crept forward until she was right at his
elbow, and now she jumped at the gems, and tried to
heap them together in her hands. Her voice and manner
were hysterical.</p>

<p>“You scoundrel!” she gasped. “You lied to me!
You said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He clutched her and pushed her back with an oath,
and many of the emeralds fell to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span></p>

<p>Her act, and the fact that his duplicity had been discovered,
enraged him. He threw her to the ground,
and, drawing his revolver, seemed on the point of
shooting her; but he thought better of it, and began to
pick up the fallen emeralds. She still clutched and
held a few of them.</p>

<p>“Gimme them!” he commanded angrily.</p>

<p>“You lied to me!” she said.</p>

<p>“What if I did? Gimme them emeralds!”</p>

<p>“Where did you get them?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your affair; give ’em to me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. They’re mine, and not yours.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take ’em!” he cried, with another oath.</p>

<p>He sprang upon her, threw her down, and by sheer
strength and brutal roughness took the gems from
her. Then he stood off regarding her. Dropping the
gems into the bag, he closed it, and thrust it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“See here!” he said, in a harsh tone, “I’m taking
care of you, and I expect to pay myself by keepin’
these, and by keepin’ you!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I dunno as I could make the words plainer. I intend
to keep these, and to keep you.” He picked up
his revolver. “So you might as well understand it
fust as last. There ain’t goin’ to be any cry-baby
bizness allowed here. I saved you from them Injuns,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I believe you lied to me in that, too!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t! If I hadn’t hustled with you, and
got away from ’em, your purty scalp would be soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
dryin’ in some Injun lodge; and that wouldn’t be pleasant
for you. Now see here!”</p>

<p>He stood before her, large, uncouth, malevolent;
a very brute of a man, whose sheer brutal strength
was enough to overawe and reduce to subjection even
a reasonably strong man.</p>

<p>“Now see here! I ain’t goin’ to fool with you!
You’re goin’ to do the things I say. I’ve got these
emeralds, and I’ve got you. Jes’ as soon as it’s safe,
I’m goin’ to make fer the Mexican line. Once across
it, I know plenty good hidin’ places. I’ll treat you
well, if you’ll let me; if you don’t let me treat ye well,
that’s your own fault, not mine. You’re goin’ to live
with me from this on as my wife.”</p>

<p>She uttered a scream, and drew back.</p>

<p>He laughed; he knew she could not get away.</p>

<p>“Hurts yer feelin’s, does it? Well, it needn’t. I’ve
seen worse-lookin’ men than I am.”</p>

<p>“But never such a villain!”</p>

<p>“Yes; even worse villains. I ain’t sich a bad lot.
I’ve taken a likin’ to you. You’re good lookin’, and,
of course, you know it. We’ll go together into Mexico,
where we’ll hide till it’s safe to git out somewheres
else. You’ll live with me as my wife, freely if you
will, but you’ll live with me jes’ the same. And I’ll
treat you well. These emeralds will be as much yourn
as mine&mdash;that is, the things they buy will. And they’ll
make us independent. I’ve done some things that will
make me want to hide away from the law for a while.
By the time we can go forth and look the world in
the eye&mdash;the Mexican world, mind ye!&mdash;you’ll not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
keerin’ much whether you’re married to me or not;
for by that time you’ll think I’m a purty good sort of
a feller. I know women. What they need is a good
whalin’, whenever they think they know it all and want
to be boss of the ranch. The Injuns have the right
of it. Whale a squaw and she’s obedient. And I
reckon it’s the same with a white woman.”</p>

<p>“Never!” she cried, starting up. “Before I would
be your wife&mdash;the wife of such a scoundrel&mdash;I’d kill
myself!”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” he said, with a roar of laughter. “A
tantrum like that is what I guess I’ll like to see occasionally;
it makes you purtier than any picture.”</p>

<span class="fs70">A SNEAKING COWARD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The terror and horror of that day with Black John
at the cave was enough to bring a shudder to Lena.
He was truculent and brutal. Having no longer necessity
to make him pretend to be what he was not, he
did not hesitate to frighten her, apparently for the
mere pleasure it gave him.</p>

<p>One thing, however, held him somewhat in check;
and that was her screams, when he became too violent
and too brutal. Unless he tied and gagged her, the
only way to keep her from screaming in terror when
he spoke too roughly to her was to keep away from
her, and permit her to have her own way. She could
not escape, for he was out in front of the cave, was
armed, and possessed such strength that she was helpless
before him.</p>

<p>Black John’s desire for quiet in and about the cave
was caused by his fear of Buffalo Bill and his pards.</p>

<p>Though he still maintained to the girl the fiction that
he had fled with her from Indians, and was hiding
from Indians, a thing on which she was now skeptical,
he did not believe Indians were near, in spite of the
surprising attack they had made.</p>

<p>His fears of Buffalo Bill mounted high. Hence,
throughout nearly the whole of that long and wearing
day he lay out on the slope before the cave, watching
the surrounding hills, and the little pass from the
gorge, by which he had reached this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span></p>

<p>He lay almost motionless, too, knowing that to move
about was to risk being seen; while, when he remained
still, his clothing blended in with the dark rock and
protected him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was seen, as night came on, not by
Buffalo Bill and his friends, but by that sneaking
coward, Toby Sam. Toby Sam knew of this cave, and
had been in it more than once with Black John; and he,
too, had fled toward it for safety after that Indian
attack.</p>

<p>Toby Sam’s caution made him mount to an eminence
and carefully inspect the surroundings of the
cave before venturing near it.</p>

<p>Knowing just where to look, his keen eyes saw
Black John sprawled at full length on the slope, and
the little glint of sunshine which fell on Black John’s
revolver.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” he said. “Wonder who else is there?
I’ll jes’ see.”</p>

<p>Toby Sam was afoot, having abandoned his horse
after he had ridden it nearly to death. He drew back,
so that Black John could not see him, and then carefully
picked his course in roundabout fashion to the
cave.</p>

<p>The sun had set by that time. Still Toby Sam, being
a cautious rascal, did not make his presence known.
He was by nature a sneak, as well as a coward, and he
sneaked now upon the man in front of the cave.</p>

<p>When not far off and on the point of making his
presence known to Black John, who seemed to be
alone, he heard Black John speak to the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span></p>

<p>It made Toby Sam’s cowardly heart jump with a
queer thrill, when he knew that Black John was speaking
of the emeralds.</p>

<p>The girl had said something of an accusing nature,
apparently, and Black John replied:</p>

<p>“Shet up about the emeralds! They’re mine, and I
propose to git a lot of money out of ’em; and on that
money we’ll live high.”</p>

<p>Toby Sam flattened himself against the rocks like a
lizard when he heard that, for he knew that Black
John had the emeralds, and he desired to get them.
He remained there without movement until darkness
had set in fully; then, with infinite patience and tortoiselike
slowness, he made an advance.</p>

<p>Black John went into the cave and came out again.
He was swearing, and was in an ugly mood. Being
hungry had made him ill-tempered.</p>

<p>“A cuss on the emeralds,” he said, “I’d trade the
very biggest of ’em fer a mouthful o’ somethin’ to eat!
I dunno but I’d better try to git out o’ this to-night,
fer to stay here long will be to starve to death.”</p>

<p>The moon came from behind a cloud while Black
John sat in front of the cave; and then Toby Sam
saw that he had the precious bag of emeralds out, and
was toying with the gems, all of which he had picked
up again.</p>

<p>For a long time Black John sat there, sometimes
muttering, sometimes as silent as the rocks. Finally
he lay down, with revolver in his hand, again to watch,
as he had done the previous night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span></p>

<p>For another hour Toby Sam remained as still as if
he had frozen into position.</p>

<p>Black John’s wakefulness of the night before, and
his lack of rest for so many hours, had told on him
at last; and Toby Sam heard him snore.</p>

<p>The time for action had come.</p>

<p>With his cowardly heart knocking against his ribs,
Toby Sam began a stealthy movement toward the
sleeping man. Only his wild anxiety to possess those
emeralds could thus have urged him on.</p>

<p>A mouse advancing could not have made less noise.</p>

<p>Within five minutes the deed was done; Toby Sam
had felt over the body of the sleeping man, and had
possessed himself of the buckskin bag that had bulged
the inner pocket of Black John’s coat.</p>

<p>Black John awoke, with a snort, before Toby Sam
had gone ten yards in his sly retreat. Perhaps some
dim recognition of what had happened had come to
disturb him. He rolled over, stretched out his arms,
breathed heavily, and then sat up.</p>

<p>Toby Sam had become as silent as the very ground
on which he lay, and his body seemed no more than a
portion of it.</p>

<p>Black John did not at once discover the loss of the
buckskin bag; but, being uneasy, he rose and walked
away from the cave, swinging his revolver, and peering
out along the slopes where the cloud-dimmed moonlight
lay.</p>

<p>Toby Sam took advantage of this to worm along
several yards farther; but again he lay still when Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
John returned to the mouth of the cave. Then Black
John discovered that the bag of emeralds was gone.</p>

<p>It was so unbelievable a thing that at first he felt in
his other pockets, thinking he must have misplaced it.
Then a great but subdued oath ripped from his lips.
He ran to the mouth of the cave, and peered in.</p>

<p>Worn out, the girl was asleep, close by the entrance.</p>

<p>Black John stooped down, plucked her by the hair,
and, with a jerk that awoke her and brought from
her a scream of pain and fright, he pulled her to her
feet.</p>

<p>Toby Sam was sliding away with eellike silence and
speed.</p>

<p>“Hand over them emeralds!” Black John demanded
of the terrified girl, as he pulled her out of the cave,
ignoring, in his rage, the danger which would come
from the screams that she uttered. He threw her
down on the ground and kicked her.</p>

<p>“Hand over them emeralds!” he cried, standing
above her. “Hand ’em over!”</p>

<p>She screamed again, and put up her hands.</p>

<p>“You thought you’d play a cute trick on me, eh?
Thought you’d sneak ’em out o’ my pocket, and then
maybe, hide ’em, and pretend to be asleep when I
looked in on ye? Hand ’em over!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got them; I don’t know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye don’t!” he drew his revolver. “This’ll
help you to recklect! Hand ’em over!”</p>

<p>Toby Sam dislodged a stone in his sinuous flight,
and it went rolling down the hillside. Hearing it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
Black John turned around with a jump of surprise,
and stared in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt that perhaps he had not been
robbed by the girl, but that some one else was the thief.</p>

<p>With revolver in hand he began to move in the direction
of that sound, peering on before him.</p>

<p>But Toby Sam was still as crafty as ever. He had
wormed into a black hole, and there he lay, doubled up
like an opossum shamming death, and with no more
sound.</p>

<p>Black John came within a yard of him, and did not
see him.</p>

<p>“I wonder what made that noise?” he muttered.
“Somethin’ started a stone. Mebbe a cussed coyote.”</p>

<p>He peered long, on the slope of the hill, returning
finally to the cave, when he could discover nothing.</p>

<p>The girl had tried to slip away during his absence,
but had become bewildered, and found herself in a
“pocket” of the rocky wall, with her way now barred
by her captor.</p>

<p>“Come out o’ there!” he snarled. “What you doin’
there?”</p>

<p>She came out, trembling.</p>

<p>“Now I ask ye ag’in fer them emeralds!”</p>

<p>“And I tell you I haven’t them!” she screamed at
him. “<em>I haven’t them</em>, do you hear, you hateful
beast?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CAPTURE OF THE THIEF.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As Toby Sam stole on, congratulating himself on
his clever theft, he tripped suddenly over what seemed
to be a grapevine in the path.</p>

<p>The supposed grapevine was a lariat, as he knew
when a man sprang on him, caught him by the throat,
jammed his head back against the ground, and commanded
him to keep silent on pain of having his throat
cut. The fingers of the man were like iron in their
hold, and the command was made in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>The place was a mile or less from the cave, and
the capture was made at a time when Toby Sam felt
absolutely sure of getting away with the emeralds.</p>

<p>The cowardly rascal coughed and gurgled, and then
lay back, quiet, staring-eyed, and weak from fear.
Then he saw that this man had comrades, two of
them, at least, who came up one on each side, and they
looked at the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Got him, eh?” There was a chuckle. “Waugh!
He’s thet pesky sneak, Toby Sam!”</p>

<p>It was Nick Nomad who spoke. Toby Sam recognized
that, and knew he had fallen into the hands of
Buffalo Bill’s party, which was as bad as, or worse,
than falling into the hands of Black John.</p>

<p>“Speak above a whisper, and you’re a dead man!”</p>

<p>The fingers relaxed as the threat was made; and
Toby Sam, clutching his aching throat, stared again at
the men who had captured him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span></p>

<p>“Search him, Gordon!”</p>

<p>Pawnee Bill “went through” the pockets of Toby
Sam. “Ah!” he said, in a tone of surprise. “What’s
this?” He had found the bag of emeralds.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s last remaining wax match illuminated
the contents of the bag, showing the nature of the find.</p>

<p>Then they began to question Toby Sam.</p>

<p>He tried to lie, at first; but the cold muzzle of Buffalo
Bill’s revolver, thrust into his face, convinced
him of the wisdom of telling the truth. Then he admitted
the theft of the emeralds from Black John,
and told where Black John was hiding with his prisoner.</p>

<p>“Hear that, Bruce?” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Another man&mdash;a young man&mdash;had crept forward,
and was listening. He was shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>“You must lead us to the place,” he said. “Is she
well, and unharmed?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think she is; she was in there, and he was
talkin’ with her, and was cussin’ her, when I came
away.”</p>

<p>“Tell us just where this little cave is,” Buffalo Bill
commanded.</p>

<p>Toby Sam told as well as he could.</p>

<p>“You’ll show us the way now. Bruce, hand me
those cords! We’ll tie his hands, and if he starts to
run we’ll shoot him.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I won’t run!” Toby Sam promised, his teeth
chattering.</p>

<p>His hands were tied by Buffalo Bill and Clayton.</p>

<p>“Now lead on,” said Buffalo Bill; “and, remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
if you make any noise, or try to warn Black John, we’ll
shoot you.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that they had captured Toby Sam
and had him for a guide, Buffalo Bill and his pards
did not go far.</p>

<p>The way was stony and rough, and they feared they
could not get near the cave without attracting Black
John’s attention. Because of the darkness Black
John’s chances of getting out of the cave and away
were considerable, if he became alarmed and tried to
escape. While, if he fancied himself undiscovered and
still safe, he would remain in the cave, and could be
captured in the morning.</p>

<p>They discussed this phase of the matter, and lay
down with their prisoner on the slope of the hill, when
still some distance from the cave.</p>

<p>Before that they had heard a scream from the girl,
which had rendered Clayton so frantic that Buffalo
Bill’s utmost persuasions were needed to keep him
from making a blind rush through the darkness. Had
he done so he would have been shot, of course, by
Black John, and perhaps the efforts of his friends
would have been balked.</p>

<p>The hours that followed held nothing but mental
torture for him. Nor were the scouts and his pards
much less concerned for the security of the girl. They
divined the situation: that the loss of the emeralds
had been discovered, and that Black John was, as a
consequence, in an unamiable and dangerous mood.</p>

<p>Black John, supposed to be keeping watch by the
cave, was as silent as the men lying farther down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the bowldered slope. If he moved, or spoke, they had
no knowledge of it; and the girl made no sound, after
that scream which had reached them.</p>

<p>Bruce Clayton tormented himself with fears that
she was dead&mdash;had been killed by Black John; or that
Black John was even then out of the cave, and far
on his way to some other point, and that Cody and
his companions were guarding what was no better than
an empty bird’s nest.</p>

<p>The morning came, after what seemed an interminable
night; but the faint light of the early morning
did not reveal Black John; and Bruce’s feverish fears
intensified. But Buffalo Bill was not ready yet to
make a move.</p>

<p>Only by combined luck and good work had he and
his pards been able to follow Black John’s trail to the
point where they had captured Toby Sam; and, after
all that work, the scout was not willing to jeopardize
anything by a premature movement.</p>

<p>Then something was seen to move on the slope.</p>

<p>It was Black John, rising from another night of
watching.</p>

<p>Still Buffalo Bill and his pards maintained silence,
waiting for the light to get better.</p>

<p>It was seen that Black John contemplated flight.
He brought the girl out of the cave, tottering as she
was with weakness; and they heard his harsh words
to her.</p>

<p>“Let me shoot him, the scoundrel!” begged Clayton.
“I can’t stand it any longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span></p>

<p>Instead, Buffalo Bill lifted his voice. “Hello,
there!” he called.</p>

<p>Black John wheeled as if on a pivot. He looked
about, and saw no one.</p>

<p>“We’ve got you covered with our revolvers,” were
the next words he heard. “If you don’t throw up your
hands and surrender, down you go.”</p>

<p>Black John did not surrender; he gave a jump for
the cave, pulling the girl backward by the hair, so
that she fell in the very entrance, and was pulled in
by him, out of sight.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.<br />
<span class="fs70">AT BAY&mdash;AT PEACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Silence reigned after that until Buffalo Bill spoke
again, announcing to Black John that he was cornered,
and demanding his surrender.</p>

<p>“Come and git me!” yelled the desperate man. “But
recklect when you do I’ll shoot the girl.”</p>

<p>“We want to have a talk with you,” said Buffalo
Bill. “We’ve got a proposition to make to you. Surrender
the girl unharmed, and we’ll spare your life.”</p>

<p>When there was no answer to this, they began to
crawl up the slope, taking Toby Sam with them.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a friend of yours here,” called Buffalo
Bill. “We’ll release him, and let him come in and tell
you the conditions here, so that you’ll know how foolish
it is for you to try to hold out against us.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” Toby Sam gurgled; “he’ll shoot me!
He’ll think I’ve turned ag’inst him; he’ll think I took
the emeralds; he’ll think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He twisted out of the way of Buffalo Bill, whose
intention of sending him to the cave he feared, and
leaping up, he tried to run.</p>

<p>It was a foolish and fatal movement.</p>

<p>Black John’s revolver cracked, and Toby Sam fell
with its bullet in his head, being dead as he struck the
ground.</p>

<p>Now at bay, Black John was desperate and murderous.
He had thought the man he shot at was one of
Buffalo Bill’s force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span></p>

<p>Silence followed the fall of Toby Sam’s body, and
it lay on the rocks, the face, ghastly in death, turned
skyward.</p>

<p>There was a movement in the cave; the next moment
Lena Forest appeared.</p>

<p>Her hands and feet were bound, but she stood erect,
while behind her, using her as a shield, Black John
crouched, like a desperate villain and craven.</p>

<p>“Remember that I’m keepin’ her in front of me
here in the mouth of this cave,” he shouted, “and if
you shoot at me the chances aire you’ll hit her. Recklect
it!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s revolver was leveled, seemingly on the
girl. The next moment its report rang out, and the
body of the man behind the girl slipped downward,
and then fell, sprawling out in the cavern entrance.</p>

<p>It was a shot such as only Buffalo Bill or Pawnee
Bill could have made.</p>

<p>In shouting his words, Black John had peered, with
one eye, over the shoulder of the girl, trying to see
the men who were hemming him in. That eye and
the forehead by it was a mark big enough for Buffalo
Bill. He sent his revolver bullet into the head of Black
John with as deadly an effect as Black John, but a
minute or so before, had sent one into the head of
Toby Sam.</p>

<hr class="r30" />

<p>Buffalo Bill and his friends remained there by the
cave for almost a week, to give Lena Forest time to
regain her strength, for her physical weakness was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
extreme. They shot game on the mountains and in
the valleys, and lived well.</p>

<p>Black John and the coward, Toby Sam, were buried
at the foot of the hill, in graves unmarked by a single
stone. As for the other outlaws, who had scattered
and fled, what became of them was not known, but the
band of “mustangers,” who had made their headquarters
recently in the valley of the Bitter Water, went
suddenly out of business.</p>

<p>When Lena had fully recovered from her exhaustion
they all returned to the fort. The day after their
arrival there, Buffalo Bill resumed his scouting expedition
in the Blackfoot country. Bruce enlisted in the
regiment stationed at the fort. Later he and Lena journeyed
to the East, taking the emeralds; and there they
were married and made their home.</p>

<p>No. 84 of the <span class="smcap">Border Stories</span>, entitled “Buffalo Bill’s
Hidden Gold,” is a thrilling story in which Indians, outlaws,
and adventurers all play a big part in hunting for
the treasure, Buffalo Bill, as usual, leading all the rest
in daring and bravery.</p>

<p>There is no more romantic character in American history than
William F. Cody, or as he was internationally known, Buffalo
Bill. He, with Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, Wild Bill Hickok,
General Custer, and a few other adventurous spirits, laid the
foundation of our great West.</p>

<p>There is no more brilliant page in American history than the
winning of the West. Never did pioneers live more thrilling
lives, so rife with adventure and brave deeds as the old scouts
and plainsmen. Foremost among these stands the imposing
figure of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>All of the books in this list are intensely interesting. They
were written by the close friend and companion of Buffalo Bill&mdash;Colonel
Prentiss Ingraham. They depict actual adventures
which this pair of hard-hitting comrades experienced, while the
story of these adventures is interwoven with fiction; historically
the books are correct.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
